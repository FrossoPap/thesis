Don\u2019t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that \u201cat one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don\u2019t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who\u2019s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google \u2018the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?\u2019 I mean, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what worried me even more,\u201d she continued, \u201cwas the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I\u2019m sitting there, thinking, \u2018Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn\u2019t paying attention during history class \u2013 a lot of someones, apparently \u2013 hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarlson also added, \u201cI mean, I know the education in our country isn\u2019t the best in the world, but I figured we\u2019d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What\u2019s the next thing I\u2019m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I\u2019m not buying it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don\u2019t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don\u2019t believe how stupid Americans can be,\u201d she said.\n\n31.4k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "Red Herald", "description": "Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15.

According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan\u2019s office has asserted that he can not be \u201cfired\u201d by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump\u2019s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn\u2019t say things he doesn\u2019t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker\u2026You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.", "authors": ["About Stryker", "Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Americas Last Line of Defense", "description": "POTUS walked right up to Ryan at a luncheon and let him know he was finished.", "title": "BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan \u2018You\u2019re Fired\u2019", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-14T18:19:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-14T18:19:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "images": ["http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gaga.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/odonnell2.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/patriotic-pets1.jpg?resize=669%2C405", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1money.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245"], "title": "President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan \u2018You\u2019re Fired\u2019 \u2013 Americas Last Line of Defense", "url": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1489515548000}, "source": "http://thelastlineofdefense.org"}, {"top_img": "http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg", "text": "Three women who all went missing in the mid-1970s have turned up, at least parts of them, in a steel industrial 55-gallon drum buried on the Clinton estate in Chappaqua, New York.

One investigator called it \u201cthe weirdest thing he\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe three women, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, were hitchhiking their way from California to New York in 1974 when they disappeared. Their last known location before heading back onto the road was a motel just outside of Little Rock.\n\nIs it a coincidence that three pretty young girls who disappeared so long ago from Arkansas ended up dead and buried on a property in upstate New York? It does if you talk to the Clintons PR people:\n\n\u201cBill and Hillary Clinton have nothing to do with this and welcome any investigation with open arms.

You people and your conspiracy theories that everyone who dies in America must have had a run-in with Hillary or Bill Clinton need to sit down.\u201d\n\nInvestigators say while they don\u2019t yet have enough to charge Bill Clinton, they certainly have enough evidence to question him. When they approached the house to do their jobs, they were met by a team of lawyers and Secret Service personnel and told that unless they have some real evidence, Mr. Clinton was unavailable.\n\nThey added that he felt really bad for those girls but hoped at least now their families have closure.

NYC Police Sargeant Michael O\u2019Leary told reporters that while he couldn\u2019t confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.\n\n\n\nEMT\u2019s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary\u2019s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.\n\n\n\nThe car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. It\u2019s obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown.

Heather most recently was arrested by officers at a nearby public park. According to police reports and statements from Watson, she had been sitting on bench supervising her 3 other children, age 2, 5, and 7, as they played with other children at the park when her baby become fussy and needed to be fed.\r\n\r\nIdaho is currently the only state that has yet to pass a law allowing mothers to breastfeed in public without the consequences of indecent exposure. The only protection that nursing mothers have in Idaho is Jury Duty exemption. A Moveon.org petition was created by The Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition in effort to bring the state up to speed with the remainder of the states throughout the country that protect nursing mothers, however despite the petition\u2019s 4,821 signatures, there is no indication that Idaho is anywhere close to passing new legislation.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding mapImage Source: The Huffington Post\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving a maximum 7-years in prison, because Watson was charged with multiple counts of indecent exposure, she will be required to register as a sex offender and will be placed on the National Sex Offender Registry.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heather\u2019s husband and close friends, she was an advocate for mother\u2019s rights and commonly took to social media websites such as Facebook to rant about her frequent indecent exposure citations and to complain about being harassed for breastfeeding her young daughter in a myriad of public locations. The below message was posted to Facebook a few weeks ago by Heather after she received her 4th citation for indecent exposure \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so frickin pissed off by the barbaric, stone-age, laws we have in Idaho. I seriously just received my 4th ticket for the \u201cindecent exposure\u201d of my breast while feeding Caylee in public. You can bet I\u2019m filing this document straight to the IDGAF folder (the trash can)!\u201d\r\n\r\nHeather Watson Facebook PostScreenshot courtesy of Facebook\r\nThough Watson\u2019s sentence is widely viewed as unnecessarily strict, Jude Walter Chapman, the sole judge presiding over Baker County and nearby Wiser, Idaho, made the following statement to reporters from a local ABC affiliate station, \u201cWe have laws in our state and due to Mrs. Watson\u2019s repeated civil disobedience it\u2019s is clear to me that she has little to no regard for the system our state was built upon. As a Judge, it\u2019s not my job to create law, but to recognize and preside over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs news of Watson\u2019s sentencing has spread throughout the media, several public breastfeeding advocate groups have come together to demand change in Idaho\u2019s current laws. They are asking anyone that disagrees with Judge Chapman\u2019s ruling to voice your feedback by calling the Baker County Department of Justice at 785-273-0325."}, {"top_img": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dsadasdasd-300x169.png", "text": "Ooops...

Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn\u2019t happy and demanded the format be changed.\n\nAccording to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly\u2019s new show:\n\n\u201cMegyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she\u2019s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.\u201d\n\nThe problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:\n\n\u201cMs. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following. Our data tells us that our audience will tolerate and even learn to like her, but not as a political pundit or someone they should take seriously. She needs to think less Diane Sawyer and more Kelly Ripa.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Kelly couldn\u2019t do that and the whole thing came to a head this afternoon, causing NBC to pay a severance clause of $150K to cancel her contract. NBC spokesman Hugh Levitt told Fox News:\n\n\u201cMegyn Kelly was a superstar until she took on Trump. Now she\u2019s a laughing stock. She could have worked a year or two and made herself $25 million. Instead she\u2019ll spend her days looking for someone else who needs a washed up hasbeen from Fox News who knows nothing but how to piss people off.\u201d\n\nSorry, Megyn.

Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has \u201csanctioned\u201d violence, as long it protects the \u201cpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.\u201d She insisted that the president is sending \u201ca signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don\u2019t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.\u201d She also linked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving \u201cnormal\u201d people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n\u201cAnd these days it has become so obvious that I\u2019m honestly surprised we\u2019re not having riots throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didn\u2019t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I\u2019m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\u201d\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that \u201cnot even slaves\u201d suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I\u2019m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to be all evolved right now, we\u2019re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He\u2019s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you\u2019ve seen in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Bachmann continued firing, \u201cI don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d She added, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I\u2019d be saying the same thing all over again,\u201d Bachmann quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out \u2013 white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I\u2019m seriously worried whether or not we\u2019ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we\u2019re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we\u2019ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another \u2013 white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that\u2019s just one step away from extinction,\u201d Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "USPOLN", "description": "On Sunday, ex-Rep.

HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!\n\nScary!\n\nFrom HuffPo:\n\nA 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.\n\nIn light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.\n\nAt 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "USA Snich", "description": "BREAKING!

We\u2019re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,\u201d Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n\u201cI love the Sixties,\u201d said Trump, continuing, \u201cI was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.\u201d In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. \u201cYou have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We\u2019re not going to give it to them, folks. They\u2019re going to have to earn their citizenship.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won\u2019t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing \u201cman-portable\u201d tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we\u2019re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.\u201d\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option \u201cextremely\u201d liberally. \u201cMy feeling is we have these weapons and we\u2019ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there\u2019s absolutely no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using them.\u201d\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. \u201cThis guy\u2019s the president of the United States and he\u2019s bowing to the Chinese. They\u2019re laughing in our faces, okay? They\u2019re laughing in our faces and if we don\u2019t do something about it, they\u2019re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we\u2019re going to have a huge problem on our hands.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County.

Post\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water.\n\nNot long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the \u201cWar of Northern Aggression.\u201d In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a \u201cfake president\u201d and Attorney General Eric Holder as \u201crabidly un-American.\u201d However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin\u2019 take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won\u2019t be our leaders. It\u2019s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it\u2019s all gonna change back. I\u2019ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don\u2019t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It\u2019s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\u201d\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter\u2019s remarks. LaPierre said, \u201cThey brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they\u2019d be better off just making me president.\u201d\n\nRead More!", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"keywords":

elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI DON\u2019T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,\u201d SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT\u2019S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.\r\n\r\n\u201cI REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE\u2019S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,\u201d SHE ADDED.\r\n\r\n\u201cDONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS, I DON\u2019T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE, AND THAT\u2019S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY.\u201d\r\n\r\nAFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GINSBERG TURNED TO HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\u201cTHERE\u2019S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SO I\u2019M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT \u2013 I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS. I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. I CAN TOLERATE THIS CHARADE OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT I COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT,\u201d SHE SAID.\r\n\r\n\u201cI AM A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I\u2019VE HAD A PROSPEROUS AND FULFILLED LIFE,\u201d JUSTICE GINSBERG ARGUED.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when I\u2019m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower."}, {"top_img": "http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1243578345290c9914eeffe4a48bada8c.jpg", "text": "On Monday the Bishop Of Rome addressed Catholic followers regarding the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance.

According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple\u2019s southern California home.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when this would come up,\u201d Bannon told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we\u2019re on the subject, I\u2019m actually disappointed; I honestly didn\u2019t expect them to take this long,\u201d he said laughingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, \u201cWell, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren\u2019t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It\u2019s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.\u201d\n\nBut, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, \u201cAlright, look, that\u2019s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you\u2019re not supposed to in a relationship, that\u2019s the whole beauty of it. And just like there\u2019s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you\u2019re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don\u2019t mean that in everyday life. I\u2019m talking about when they\u2019re performing their marital duties,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why I find these charges preposterous, they\u2019re so idiotic that I\u2019m not even sure how they\u2019re still interesting,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cBecause, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re in love, everything\u2019s allowed, I don\u2019t care what anyone says, when you say the words \u2018I do,\u2019 and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?\u201d he concluded.\n\nsource:politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "USPOLN", "description": "The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.\n\nAccording to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.\n\nWilliam Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\n\n\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.\n\nUpon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.\n\nPolice also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.\n\nIn addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.\n\nUpon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.\n\nVernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\n\n\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.\n\nAll three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.", "authors": ["Anthony Brooks"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Anthony Brooks", "og": {"site_name": "The Miami Gazette", "description": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.", "title": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 956, "identifier": "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png", "height": 632}, "updated_time": "2017-05-30T13:44:24+00:00", "url": "http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png", "description": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "Vernal Heights", "published_time": "2017-05-30T13:43:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-30T13:44:24+00:00"}}, "canonical_link": "http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/", "images": ["http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Basement-Fridge.png", "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Basement.png", "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Police-Spokesman.png", "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Home.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/297522ab22952144f7a0e9e8f1d75843?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Tools.png", "http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png"], "title": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression", "url": "http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1496151793000}, "source": "http://themiamigazette.com"}, {"title": "BREAKING Clinton Foundation Ordered To Cease Operations \u2013 Chelsea Charged With Fraud", "text": "As we know, Clinton Foundation has been given an A+ as a charitable organization.

Trey Gowdy, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested in a Friday interview that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will be forced out at the top law enforcement agency as soon as next week.\r\n\r\nGowdy argued that newly released FBI records reveal political bias against President Donald Trump \u2014 and in favor of Hillary Clinton \u2014 at the highest levels of the FBI. Gowdy said that McCabe will likely be pushed out of the agency as a result of the perceived bias.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,\" Gowdy told Fox News of McCabe, adding that he would be \"shocked\" if McCabe testifies before the House next week.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Gowdy settled a $150,000 veteran discrimination and retaliation claim from a former aide, who was fired in 2015 from the House Benghazi committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The aide alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in part for his unwillingness to engage in what he believed was a partisan investigation into Hillary Clinton's time as US secretary of state.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators have escalated sharply in recent weeks, culminating in a partisan haranguing of the FBI director last week over the perceived missteps of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nConservative and far-right media outlets, already skeptical of Mueller's probe into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia, grew louder in their calls for FBI Director Chris Wray to either clean house or for Mueller to resign. It came after news that two special counsel investigators at one point exhibited perceived political bias.\r\n\r\nTrump again characterized the criminal justice system as \"rigged\" during a rally in Florida on Friday, echoing comments he made last weekend following former national security Michael Flynn's guilty plea as part of Mueller's probe.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump lamented the state of the FBI, the nation's top law-enforcement agency, shortly before delivering a speech at an FBI graduation ceremony on Friday in Quantico, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI, but we're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever,\" Trump told reporters before boarding Virginia-bound Marine One on Friday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president also recently described the country's top law-enforcement agency as \"in tatters,\" but a White House spokesman said on Friday that Trump had \"full faith and confidence\" in the rank-and-file members of the Department of Justice and the FBI.\r\n\r\nAlso on Friday morning, Hogan Gidley, the White House's deputy press secretary, said that recently released FBI records showed \"extreme bias\" against Trump among leadership at the FBI.\r\n\r\nRecently disclosed text messages between two FBI agents assigned to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign included a reference to Trump as an \"idiot.\" Both agents are no longer involved in the Russia investigation. Other records revealed edits made to soften the statement of James Comey, then the FBI director, concerning the agency's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\r\n\r\nGidley called the records \"eye-opening\" and \"deeply troubling.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time,\" Gidley told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday morning."}, {"top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/streep.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "text": "Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 56.9k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nAfter saying 6 minutes of mean things about Donald Trump without ever once using his name, humiliating him in front of a crowd of Hollywood elites and millions watching around the world, Meryl Streep got word From Ron Howard that she was no longer being cast as an older, wiser version of Mrs. C in a reboot of Happy Days that was to make her millions.\n\nStreep was to team up with Otis Winslow of \u201cFamily Matters\u201d so Happy Days could be written into this century, with multi-racial families, gender identity and the gays playing a role in the plotlines. Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn\u2019t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff. Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn\u2019t get the part.\n\nNow the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nMeryl Streep, who hasn\u2019t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement.

According to the testimony of several witnesses, Darren Winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n\n\u201cDarren\u2019s a recreational diver,\u201d commented one of the injured man\u2019s friends. \u201cFor some time, he\u2019s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he\u2019d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\u201d\n\nMr Winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in Ybor, telling them he\u2019d finally perfected what he called his \u2018scuba bong\u2019. \u201cClearly it wasn\u2019t a bong at all,\u201d pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, \u201cbut he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.\u201d\n\nWhen his friends assembled at Mr Winter\u2019s residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. \u201cHe\u2019d had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his \u2018scuba bong\u2019 up and running.\u201d With his friends present, Mr Winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. This is the point that everything went horribly wrong.\n\nAccording to the witnesses, Mr Winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. \u201cThe tank basically exploded after [Winters] knocked it over,\u201d commented one of the witnesses. None of Winter\u2019s friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.\n\nWinter\u2019s friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. His condition has now been downgraded from \u2018critical\u2019 to \u2018serious\u2019, but medical staff announced they\u2019d been unable to save his testicles which had been \u2018cleanly severed\u2019 by a shard of metal.\n\nPreliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by Winters may be banned from dive use throughout the US. \u201cThis tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing,\u201d commented the lead investigator on the case. \u201cWe regularly audit dive shops in Tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. If [Winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.\u201d\n\nThis news will be little comfort to Mr Winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. The young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the toughest guys I know,\u201d commented one of Mr Winter\u2019s friends. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the fact he won\u2019t be able to have kids pretty hard, though.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. Mr Winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a Tampa pizza restaurant. We regret the error.\n\nIn other news making headlines, a 68-year old man from Decatur in Northern Alabama has discovered that his new bride is actually his own grand-daughter.

NBC news predicted that all Americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems Australia may have already beaten them to it. Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.\n\nNow, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.\n\nUnder the headline \u2018Australians embracing super-human microchip technology\u2019, Australia\u2019s premier media outlet news.com.au (News Corp Australia) reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.\n\nShanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.\n\nShe told news.com.au:\n\n\u201cYou could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs it\u2019s the same technology as Paypass, so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be able to pay for things with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card \u2026 it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.\u201d\n\nThe microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. In her interview with the Australian news outlet, Shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:\n\n\u201cMy nana wants one. I\u2019ve had more opposition to my tattoos than I\u2019ve ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called \u201csuper humans.\u201d On the same day this news story broke, Shanti appeared at Austarlia\u2019s launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided, alongside American implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.\n\nAs you can see, the push for RFID microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become \u201csuper human,\u201d but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. If you think the elites wouldn\u2019t capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously don\u2019t know history very well.\n\nAmal Graafstra, who became one of the world first RFID implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the US with a prototype of the world\u2019s first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.\n\nHe\u2019s written a book, spoken at TEDx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.\n\nIn an interview with the Australian media outlet, Amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has \u201cgiven me the ability to communicate with machines. It\u2019s literally integrated into who I am.\u201d\n\nShanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.\n\nEver since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all weren\u2019t living as \u2018super-humans\u2019.\n\nClick to WATCH: Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Native American Stuff", "description": "Australia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public.

Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\n\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s approach in the 1930\u2019s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat.

But this time, NASA confirms what\u2019s been circling the web recently \u2013 our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.\r\n\r\nNASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn\u2019t know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.\r\nimages (4).jpg\r\nAccording to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.\r\nAccording to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus\u2019 bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.\r\nOnce the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun\u2019s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6 \u2013 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter\u201d, Bolden said."}, {"top_img": "http://usadailynews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/169.jpg", "text": "The biggest story this week was the arrest of Pakistani Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan. Earlier this year, Awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. Shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and Imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. In his attempt to avoid facing justice, Awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport. This, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after Imran hired his lawyer. The lawyer that was hired to defend Imran was no other but a close Clinton family associate and lawyer Chris Gowen.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Review:\n\nIn 2012, Gowen went to bat for Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. After GOP reps explored Abedin\u2019s nefarious ties, Gowen pledged to \u201cstand with Huma.\u201d\n\nAlong with his private practice, the longtime Clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.\n\nGowen\u2019s Clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that Awan\u2019s employer in the House, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, remains a close Clinton confidant. The former Democratic National Committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the Democratic primary in Clinton\u2019s favor. Wasserman Schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s first failed run for president.\n\nReading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. In fact, ABC, NBC, and CBS have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. Of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. However, that has not stopped Americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nNow, they are reports that Debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since Imran\u2019s arrest. Also, there are calls for Debbie to testify before Congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Fighters:\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.\n\nImran Awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the U.S. after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan. Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal. When Imran Awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.\n\nImran and his Muslim brothers, Abid and Jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as IT specialists. The three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.\n\nWord has it that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an absolute wreck since Imran Awan was arrested. Calls for her to testify to Congress are increasingly growing as well.\n\nWasserman Schultz knows she\u2019s in hot water over this IT scandal. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the FBI seized smashed hard drives belonging to Imran Awan. We also reported that Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with \u2018consequences\u2019 for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani IT staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.\n\nIt is rather clear in watching the video that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide. Since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the Clinton\u2019s?\n\nJohn Cardillo reports, \u2018Florida politicos who have known Wasserman Schultz for years are telling me she\u2019s a nervous wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awan\u2019s arrest.\n\nFL politicos who have known @DWStweets for years are telling me she's a nervous wreck, barely able to function, since #ImranAwan's arrest. \u2014 John Cardillo (@johncardillo) July 27, 2017\n\nThen someone witnessed Wasserman Schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public. Is it possible that Wasserman Schultz is realzing that the DNC is crumbling all around her now?\n\nMELTDOWN: From trusted source\u2013 @DWStweets seen screaming at teen daughter today in public over a 2$ purse pic.twitter.com/i7Y0RI9c8S \u2014 Jim Hoft (@gatewaypundit) July 28, 2017\n\nEstablishment Media Refuse To Cover House IT Scandal Rocking Democrats https://t.co/LNwZHmknTf pic.twitter.com/QoknOsz3C8 \u2014 The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 27, 2017\n\nThis is why alternative news is exploding over the traditional sources of media. The mainstream media is refusing to cover this story but will report the fake Russian collusion story, and President Trump\u2019s ban on transgenders in the military. They will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed.\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz holds the key to many answers that the American people deserve to know. Hopefully, by keeping the pressure on Wasserman Schultz she will crack and we can get to the bottom of the DNC corruption once and for all.\n\nSHARE IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH EXPOSED!", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The biggest story this week was the arrest of\u00a0Pakistani\u00a0Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan.

During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate\u2019s version of the health care bill is signed into law. \u201cWhat they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy something they don\u2019t want, then they won\u2019t buy it,\u201d the Speaker opined. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it\u2019s that people will choose not to buy something that they don\u2019t like or want.\u201d\n\nKilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is \u201ca choice.\u201d \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been over on more than once occasion,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know why you\u2019re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I\u2019m sorry Brian, but it\u2019s not working. And the reason why it\u2019s not working is, you\u2019re using the wrong logic here. You\u2019re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don\u2019t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?\u201d Ryan opined. \u201cThe answer is \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that\u2019s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that\u2019s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you\u2019re doomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing rich or poor is a matter of choice; that\u2019s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they\u2019re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we\u2019d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We\u2019d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. \u2018Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen \u2013 the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don\u2019t even have to get a job.\u2019 That\u2019s preposterous, anyone who thinks that\u2019s a good thing deserves to be poor,\u201d he concluded.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news", "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Newslo", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan.

Now Tax Returns are brought up again?\u201d Trump tweeted.\r\n\r\nAs always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trump\u2019s second son argued that his father\u2019s tax return is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d largely because \u201che knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.\u201d\r\n\r\nEric continued, \u201cAnd while we\u2019re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it\u2019s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That\u2019s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I\u2019m not saying something that\u2019s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he\u2019s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That\u2019s a catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to \u201cfix\u201d the broken tax system of the United States. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It won\u2019t matter soon anyway,\u201d Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that \u201ccancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our way of saying \u2018good job\u2019 to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn\u2019t have to pay tax; like I said, it\u2019s a sort of \u2018thank you\u2019 from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they\u2019ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going with this. Bottom line, if you\u2019ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you\u2019re going to have to pretty soon,\u201d Eric concluded."}, {"top_img": "http://viraldevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-14.jpeg", "text": "Rasheed Thompson, 39 of Chicago, was arrested in connection with a series of dead bodies found in a freezer located in his basement.

In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.\n\n\u201cIf the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,\u201d Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. \u201cWashington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.\n\n\u201cWe did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you\u2019ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think this is the best thing,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cHe has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it\u2019s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.\u201d\n\nAfter word spread of Trump\u2019s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.\n\n\u201cI think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he\u2019s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.\u201d\n\nLloyd Glacier, a spokesman for \u2018Sock It Forward\u2018, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump\u2019s plan to resign.\n\n\u201cThis will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.\u201d\n\n38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,\u201d Horner said. \u201cTrump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it\u2019s all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, you\u2019re all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much!

Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.\n\nUpon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news.\n\nChurch\u2019s Chicken and Popeye\u2019s Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment.\n\nIncidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies\u2019 restaurants if they don\u2019t share their respective secret recipes with him.\n\nThe Red Shtick will update this story as new attacks from the White House on

Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he\u2019s not.

We don\u2019t choose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they\u2019ve been chosen and know that that\u2019s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children\u2019s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.\n\nEvangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert\u2019s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:\n\n\u201cIf Christians don\u2019t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\u201d\n\nCopeland appeared on Colbert\u2019s \u201cPray for America\u201d call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "ALTERNATIVE MEDIA SYNDICATE", "description": "Donald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money\u00a0he owed them.

Temperatures reached 270\u00b0 during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.\r\n\r\nThe company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.\r\n\r\nRodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. \u201cWe remain devastated by the loss of her colleague Jos\u00e9 Melena in the tragic accident,\u201d company said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the Los Angeles Dist.

The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That\u2019s not what she should be doing.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Indiana also said that she \u201chas no business\u201d commenting on men and their \u201crestroom talk,\u201d as well as that that\u2019s not \u201cladylike behavior.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the word \u2018lady\u2019 is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she\u2019s not behaving like one, at least as of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she was a real lady, she wouldn\u2019t be commenting on men\u2019s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn\u2019t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence.

The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump\u2019s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President\u2019s ice cream from the carton.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President\u2019s eating habits to the press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s borderline creepy,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he\u2019s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It\u2019s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s McDonalds habits are even weirder.\n\n\u201cHe orders the same thing every time,\u201d said the staffer. \u201cHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M\u2019s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it.

Go after everything you want to go after.

This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.\n\nWithout Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It\u2019s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won\u2019t make it out of this investigation so easily.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

It wouldn't just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as \"disruptive.\" Broadly interpreted, this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve already hit our initial goal of 50,000 signatures on the petition. But now that the bill has been introduced, we need to get even more people speaking out. If everyone reading this shares the video, we can easily get 100,000 signatures before we deliver it to the Washington State lawmakers.\r\n\r\nCharging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the First Amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent. Please sign the petition telling lawmakers to reject this dangerous legislation.\r\nHere's the text of the petition:\r\n\r\n\"Organizing and participating in protests is a basic Constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment.

John Kasich vetoed the so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman\u2019s life or preventing the \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,\u201d Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. \u201cWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn\u2019t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,\u201d the governor concluded.\n\nSource:newslo.com", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.9", "og": {"site_name": "WalkWithHer", "description": "Recently, Republican Ohio Gov.

He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIA\u2019s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.\n\nIn 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.\n\nAll of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.\n\nHe currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n\u201cI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA\u2019s payroll,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201d\n\nSnowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\u201d\n\nNaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.\n\nDespite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.\n\nWhilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a society that does these sort of things\u2026 I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.\u201d\n\nSource : Unknown But Not Hidden; Image Source: Awareness Act", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"ca_image": "http://www.antinews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Edward-Snowden-Osama-Bin-Laden-Is-Alive-And-Well-In-The-Bahamas__1488574305_45.126.237.0-150x150.jpg", "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Anti News Network", "description": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas", "title": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "http://www.antinews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Edward-Snowden-Osama-Bin-Laden-Is-Alive-And-Well-In-The-Bahamas__1488574305_45.126.237.0.jpg", "url": "http://www.antinews.in/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.antinews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Edward-Snowden-Osama-Bin-Laden-Is-Alive-And-Well-In-The-Bahamas__1488574305_45.126.237.0.jpg", "description": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas", "card": "summary", "title": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas - Anti News Network"}, "fb": {"pages": 1101259469943578}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.antinews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14908370_1782421858673034_4749262631277297409_n.png", "article": {"section": "Conspiracy Archive", "published_time": "2017-05-13T03:21:25-07:00"}, "ca_title": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.antinews.in/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/", "images": ["http://www.antinews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Edward-Snowden-Osama-Bin-Laden-Is-Alive-And-Well-In-The-Bahamas__1488574305_45.126.237.0.jpg"], "title": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas", "url": "http://www.antinews.in/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ksatFd8gkY"], "publish_date": {"$date": 1494670885000}, "source": "http://www.antinews.in"}, {"top_img": "http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/marco-rubio-645x325.jpg", "text": "At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen.

However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: \u201cDon\u2019t know yet, first thing\u2019s first here.

WQe cannot let them get away with these things!\n\nEither assimilate, or LEAVE.\n\nThey are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It\u2019s their faith.

The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can\u2019t get legally at all.\n\nAsked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that \u201cabortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.\u201d \u201cSo, let\u2019s get that straight right away \u2013 I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn\u2019t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we\u2019re murderers of innocent beings who can\u2019t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?\u201d the Indiana governor said.\n\n\u201cAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Pence continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that\u2019s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost \u2013 we can\u2019t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let\u2019s be clear. And that\u2019s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I\u2019m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. \u201cFirst and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new running mate also said, \u201cBasically, if I\u2019d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they\u2019d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it\u2019s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher\u2019s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it gets worse \u2013 when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana\u2019s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I\u2019m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,\u201d Pence concluded.", "authors": ["Alex Stevan"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news", "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Newslo", "description": "The Republican war on women continues unabated.

Just moments ago, Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh confirmed that The coroner just left the scene where Monica Lewinsky, who we now know never ended her affair with Clinton, was found murdered in a burglary.\n\nPolice Chief Randall Getty told Leweigh:\n\n\u201cPretty cut and dry. We have a suspect we think we have on several area cameras who is a known pot addict. He\u2019s been in and out of jail more than a dozen times for possession.

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2013 literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\n\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201d\n\nThis method was developed by the KGB, which became the FSB following the fall of the USSR.\n\nWhat we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for Donald Trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by Russian agents from the FSB (formerly the KGB).\n\n\u201cIf people were not beholden to Russia, they would have voted for Hillary Clinton,\u201d a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by CrowdStrike, a contractor hired by the DNC to investigate Russian space-beam mind control.\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the response from Peskov \u201cpredictable,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat do you expect from the criminal Putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the Ukraine, murdered innocent Syrians and hacked our elections by controlling people\u2019s brains with a space-beam?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million American voters are working directly for Russia, Senator John McCain has called for mass arrests. He referred to all Trump voters as \u201cradical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights,\u201d and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to Syrian refugees.\n\nTOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!", "authors": ["Us Politics Info"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"ca_image": "https://uspoliticsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jamescomey_070815fr-618x348-2-150x150.jpg", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Us Politics Info", "og": {"site_name": "Us Politics Info", "description": "Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB).

Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.\n\nTrump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama\u2019s arrest.

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.\n\nWhat he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201cYou have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\u201d\n\nWHEELER: \"For sure...\"\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201c...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\"\n\nWHEELER: \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"\n\nIn the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.\n\nSince Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as \"miscommunication.\"\n\nWhen asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.\n\nWe reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, \"The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal story:\n\nIt has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah.

Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:\n\nFamily of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murder\n\nRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operatives\n\nMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public's help\n\nRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks founder addresses death of DNC staffer Seth Rich in Fox News interview\n\nComments by Julian Assange fuel speculation that murdered DNC staffer may have been WikiLeaks source\n\nWhat happened during final hours slain DNC employee Seth Rich was alive?\n\nParents of slain DNC employee make emotional plea to help find son's killer\n\nDNC honors murdered staffer Seth Rich with memorial bike rack outside of headquarters\n\nVigil held for slain DNC staffer in Bloomingdale\n\nDNC employee fatally shot in Northwest DC", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital.

I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nJohnson goes on to explain in great detail how he fell victim to a sexually promiscuous fugitive who is wanted for allegedly infecting at least 240 people with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.\n\nLadies, as you read Joshua\u2019s story below, keep in mind that black women are the fastest growing HIV demographic in the U.S. due to bisexual men who in relationships with women because they are confused about their sexuality.\n\nGay and bisexual men, regardless of race, are more sexually promiscuous than their heterosexual counterparts, according to Seekingarrangement.com and other reports.\n\nAuthorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Isaac Don Burks, aka Stephawn Burks, Stefan Levine, Isaac Levine, Stefan Burks, and Walter Brooks.\n\nBurks is described as an African-American male, medium brown skin, six feet two inches tall, weighing 185 pounds. The NYPD is looking for a fugitive they say has embarked on a terrifying campaign to \u201cinfect as many people as possible\u201d with the HIV virus, and they caution that his victims could run into the hundreds.\n\nIsaac Don Burks, 31, has been indicted on eight counts of criminal transmission of HIV, prosecutors announced Friday, and warned that Burks targets people via popular gay websites and networking apps, such as Adam4Adam, Grindr, Jackd, and BGCLive.\n\nBurks, a black gay man from West New York, NJ, just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his \u201cmission to infect as many people as possible\u201d with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as \u201csick in the head\u201d by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims. The victrim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcolhol, to \u201cbring their guard down.\u201d\n\nAccording to New York City Health Department spokesperson Kate Caraway, this is the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that anyone who may have injected drugs with, who may have had sex with him, does come forward and get tested,\u201d she Caraway. \u201cWe want to make sure that they\u2019re not spreading the virus to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information regarding Burks\u2019 whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 888-CRIMESC (888-274-6372). Your call will remain anonymous.\n\nThis makes the report we did on Craig Lamar Davis passing HIV around the Full Gospel Baptist Church seem like nothing.\n\nNow read Joshua Johnson story in his own words below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Burks aka Isaac Don Burks Pictured Above\n\nI met Stephawn, (Real Name: Isaac Burks \u2013 Isaac Don Burks), when I was 19 years old. I had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to attend Clark Atlanta University. At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nYou see, my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician. I came from a very stable background, and my parents were heavily into the church. They controlled everything in my life. They financed my education, sent me money every month, and paid virtually every bill that I had. They wanted to see me succeed in life, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them.\n\nWhen I moved to Atlanta I met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation. I pulled strength from these men, and bonded with them immediately. They taught me that it was ok to be gay, and that life was too short to live my life for others. Over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men. I felt comfortable. I felt that I could express myself without judgement, and\u2026. for the first time ever I felt accepted. As time passed by, I started coming out of the closet a little more each day. At first, I would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed. My friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time. I was nervous! You see, I had a sister who attended Spelman College and four other male cousins who attended Clark. The last thing I needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. That would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.\n\nI eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. We loaded up into my friends Ford Explorer and headed over to a club called Traxx. Apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in Atlanta attended on Saturday. I remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. It was huge! There had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. Because we were underage, we couldn\u2019t drink. Apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. After awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. Clubs aren\u2019t as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. While standing on the side I noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. He was very attractive, and every time I would catch him looking in my direction I would look the other way. This entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so I didn\u2019t know what to take his stares for. Eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. He told me that I looked familiar, and asked me where I was from. I told him that I was from Charlotte North Carolina, and I couldn\u2019t possibly look familiar. I had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. He asked me why I wasn\u2019t drinking, and I told him we couldn\u2019t buy drinks because we were all under 21. He offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. I jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. After all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.\n\nHe returned minutes later with three drinks. The drinks he ordered for us were Long Island Iced Teas. I remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. It was very strong. Rather than be rude and waste his money, I drank it slowly. Stephawn then asked why I was babysitting my drink. I asked what did he mean by that, because I had never heard the phrase used before. He told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. By the time the second round came, I was feeling nice. We continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.\n\nAfter the third round I was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. Every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. After awhile my friends wanted to leave, and I told him that I would catch up with him later. He asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. I ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.\n\nWe ended up leaving the club an hour later. While taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on E. We pulled into an apartment complex in the Lindbergh area of buckhead. He told me to come up with him so I did. As soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. We eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. He started unbuckling my my pants, and I stopped him. I confessed that I was a virgin and didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing.\n\nHe told me to relax, and that everything was cool. He said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. He made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. Then he took my pants off. I was tense and nervous. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but he was so attractive I wanted every ounce of this man. The first thing he did was start eating my ass and I moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. Next he started sucking my d***k from the back while I was laying on my stomach. It felt amazing. I wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. Then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. He grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. He rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. He slowly put his finger inside of my ass. I moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. After awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. I immediately stopped him! I asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? I said because I didn\u2019t come to Atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. He ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and I said that\u2019s cool but we just met. If we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. He jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. I watched him put the condom on, and then I buried my face into the pillow. It was painful at first. I didn\u2019t understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. I had to stop him several times, because I could not take the pain. After about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. I couldn\u2019t take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him, and I didn\u2019t want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. I decided to \u201cman up\u201d and squirted some more lube on my ass. I laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. He inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didn\u2019t hurt as much. He started to increase his stroke, and I had no problem taking it. He was grabbing my waist, and I attempted to throw my ass back like I had seen in the porno movies. Whatever I was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. After 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. As he came I felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. I jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! I screamed what happened to the condom? He grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. There was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. I ran to the bathroom, because it felt like I had to s***t. When I used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. It was allot. I kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. That was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because I watched him put the condom on.\n\nI came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. I said nigga I just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. I asked him if he took the f***king condom off. He said no. He said that it must have broke. I wasn\u2019t buying it, and I searched around for the condom. I found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. The condom wasn\u2019t broke at all! I rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. I screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isn\u2019t broken. He told me that I was tripping, and I ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. I filled the condom with water and it didn\u2019t leak at all! When I did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. I felt betrayed, I was scared for my life, and I was hurt. I had heard about Atlanta being one of the cities with the highest AIDS rates in the country, and I was determined not to be a statistic.\n\nI got my things, and got out of his house. This asshole didn\u2019t even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. As I waited outside of his apartments in the cold, I called a cab service. They arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. The entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. I didn\u2019t answer his calls, because I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. There was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. I know some guys get off by that, but I was disgusted by it.\n\nThe thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. As the liquor wore off, I went into a deep depression. When I got to my dorm, I popped two tylenol pm\u2019s and fell alseep.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about my experience. How could I explain that I had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. I had just met this man. I didn\u2019t even know his real name. When my friends asked me what happened, I said nothing and gave them a look that said \u201cdon\u2019t ask me anymore questions!\u201d. They didn\u2019t ask, and I didn\u2019t tell. That experience frightened me so bad that I decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. That meant pulling back from my \u201cgay friends\u201d too, because I was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. I started hanging more with my straight friends. After all, I had to keep my charade up. I had family that attended my school, so I couldn\u2019t be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.\n\n8 months later while home for Christmas break I had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. This was something my mother made me do ever year since I can remember. My doctor asked me was I sexually active, and I said no. I told him that I had sex once, but that was it. I wasn\u2019t sexually active, because I wasn\u2019t actively having sex. He told me that he was going to include an HIV test in my regular blood work anyway. A few days later I received a call from his office. It wasn\u2019t the doctor, it was one of the office workers. She was obviously new, because I didn\u2019t recognize her voice. She told me that I needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. I was confused. I asked her what \u201csomething\u201d was, and she said that she couldn\u2019t release this information over the phone and that I should come in Today. This was very unusual, because I had never had this happen before and I had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. At first I thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. There was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. I borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctor\u2019s office. I didn\u2019t want to scare her, so I didn\u2019t mention what I was borrowing the car for.\n\nI will never forget what happened next. As I arrived to my doctor\u2019s office, I was told to have a seat in the waiting room. There was soft music playing that turned out to be Barry Manilow\u2019s Daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! I hated that f***king song. I was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when I was being called into my doctor\u2019s office to discuss my lab results. Before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. It was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. Brighter than usual. He began to look over my charts and lab results. He grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but your HIV results\n\ncame back positive. I swear I didn\u2019t even hear the word positive, I just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. I said, I\u2019m sorry but there must be some mistake. I am not sexually active. I\u2019ve only had sex once! I haven\u2019t had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. He said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.\n\nI thought about committing suicide. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not focus on school. I couldn\u2019t do anything but cry. My doctor couldn\u2019t legally tell my mother I was HIV positive, but I was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the HIV meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. I tried to get in contact with Stephawn but his number was disconnected.\n\nWhen I got back to school, I went over to the apartment complex where he lived but I couldn\u2019t remember the apartment number. I had no way of reaching this guy. I wanted to kill him, and i was going to. I had a butcher knife and I was going to stab him thru the heart, because I knew this guy had given me HIV, because I didn\u2019t have sex with anyone else. As time passed, I became so depressed that I eventually dropped out of school. I kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when I\u2019m going to die soon. I lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. I decided to drop out of school, because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it all. I had no one to turn to. I couldn\u2019t tell my friends, and I couldn\u2019t tell my parents. Can you imagine telling your mother that you are HIV positive after a one night stand. I couldn\u2019t dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.\n\nToday I read the article about Isaac Burks and saw his picture. This is the same guy who told me his name was Stephawn. This is the guy that gave me HIV! He ruined my life. I finally ended up telling my parents because I could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. My mother didn\u2019t cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. Later on that night as I got up to use the bathroom I heard her crying in her room. Tears immediately started pouring down my face and I ran to the kitchen. I slit my wrist. I wanted to die. I fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. I have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. Accepting the fact that I am HIV positive has been very hard. I still have not been able to return to school, and I have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.\n\nTo the sick f***k Isaac Burks, also known as Stephawn who gave me HIV, I hope you rott in hell. Now that I know his real name I will contact the authorities and tell my story. Every day I hope that things will get better, and it doesn\u2019t. I ask \u201cWhy me?\u201d every day. What did I do to deserve this? I have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. I just know the minute I tell them my HIV status they will be out of the door. I am going to die alone. The last time I tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. But I cant. I have nothing to live for. I am alive, but I am not living.\n\nI cried as I typed this post. I relived it, but felt I had to share my story. After finally coming out to my friends with my story I later found out that there were others that this man infected with HIV.\n\n\n\nRead Isaac Don Burks Response on his Facebook Page Below:\n\nIsaac Don Burks Facebook Page\n\nI can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading HIV to hundreds of people. I would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around, but i have a life to live. I have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner. I am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life. I have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my best-friend to this at such a young age. It baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story. Loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous. Im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie CANNOT WIN. See sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster. I pray for you whoever you are. See my GOD doesn\u2019t allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent. I can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. SATAN get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper!!!!! For the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u WWJD, what if this was you or your brother, uncle, cousin, farther. I\u2019m not madd because i know who i am and im better then this. When your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want. I dont have anyhing else really to say besides GOD BLESS you all", "authors": ["John Smith", "So Focused", "Messy Mae", "Fishertown Pa", "What's It To You", "Lenette Blackshear", "Sharon Young", "Margo Alverson", "Completely Understand", "Claudette Y"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "Obnoxioustv's Blog", "title": "New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With\u00a0HIV!!! | Obnoxioustv's Blog on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Obnoxioustv's Blog", "description": "This will blow your mind\u2026Read how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women. \u201cI met Stephawn when I was 19 years old,\u201d explains Joshua\u2026", "title": "New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!", "url": "https://obnoxioustelevision.com/2013/03/05/new-york-man-wanted-for-infecting-240-men-and-women-with-hiv/", "image": "https://obnoxioustv.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130305-000628.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With\u00a0HIV!!!"}, "image": "http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/484286_514400635251223_2005542494_n.jpg?w=240", "site": "@WilliamGMcCray", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WilliamGMcCray"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "You've officially been choked by the Bow Tie!", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=WordPress.com Forums;action-uri=http://forums.wordpress.com/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-03-05T04:45:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-03-05T07:55:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "This will blow your mind...Read how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women. \u201cI met Stephawn when I was 19 years old,\u201d explains Joshua Johnson on his blog.

U.S.\n\nThese scientists all shared a common trait; they had all discovered that Nagalase enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then administrated to humans.\n\nNagalese is what prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body, which is the body's main defense to naturally kill cancer cells.\n\n(SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO)\n\nAccording to Thebigriddle.com: Nagalase is a protein that's also created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. And they're PUTTING it in our vaccines!!\n\nThis prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune system. It's also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes. So basically\u2026they weren't killing these doctors because they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating autism\u2026 they're killing them because these Dr's had been researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they're injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current cancer and autism crisis!!\n\nAnd that it's obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! The Dr's they killed in FL had been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the information.\n\n\n\nDepopulation 101..add poison to vaccines\u2026make it law that all children must be injected to attend school.

We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it\u2019s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you\u2019re prepared for.\n\nNASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u201cRest Studies\u201d \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.\n\nSo what is the exact purpose of these studies?\n\nThese studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.\n\nThe Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.\n\nThis study is designed to achieve three core tasks:\n\nExamining how the astronauts\u2019 changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.\n\nExamining if the astronauts\u2019 physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.\n\nPreparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.\n\nThe study\u2019s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.\n\nThe exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you\u2019re in the exercising or non-exercising group.\n\nOnce the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you\u2019ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you\u2019ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You\u2019ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.\n\nDuring the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s immunity system.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nYou may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.\n\nThis will probably be your only opportunity to say that you\u2019ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.", "authors": ["Mr

substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump\u2019s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump\u2019s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that \u201cPresident\u201d Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump \u2018s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trump\u2019s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump\u2019s support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.\n\nPlease share this story on Facebook!", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Trump got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.", "og": {"site_name": "Learn Progress", "description": "Trump got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.", "title": "BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.learnprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump_dapl_0208.jpg", "height": 629}, "updated_time": "2017-02-16T16:46:33-05:00", "url": "http://www.learnprogress.org/trump-caught-investing-pipeline/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"partner": "tfwp", "image": "http://www.learnprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump_dapl_0208.jpg", "description": "CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline.

The SUV she was driving rolled over several times and ended up in a drainage ditch.\r\n\r\nGovernor Palin was taken to a local hospital under an alias in case the hit and run were on purpose and not a random act of reckless driving. According to her spokesman, she is currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh.\r\n\r\nThe Palin family has been notified and are currently making their way to her bedside.

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.\n\nBut that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer\u2019s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won\u2019t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties.

ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.\n\nWhether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian\u2013they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.\n\nA Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.\n\nState Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver\u2019s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.\n\nSpencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer\u2019s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.\n\n\u201cThis bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,\u201d Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nMany people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.\n\nHere is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?\n\nQuran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\n\nI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\n\nFight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.\n\nIs that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?\n\nJust for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone\u2013so how is this any different?\n\nThere is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.\n\nWhile Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.\n\nThe threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"ca_title": "GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!!", "generator": "WordPress 4.7.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ca_image": "http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image-42-660x330-150x150.jpeg"}, "canonical_link": "http://news4everyday.com/2017/06/26/georgia-becomes-first-state-to-ban-muslim-culture-in-historic-move-to-restore-western-values/", "images": ["http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/caitlyn-bathroom-150x150.jpg", "http://royalcolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/x4ujzdtn9uoh3jepyza5zg.png", "http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_2-150x150.png", "http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/benji-taylor-150x150.png", "http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image-42-660x330.jpeg"], "title": "GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! \u2013 News 4 Everyday", "url": "http://news4everyday.com/2017/06/26/georgia-becomes-first-state-to-ban-muslim-culture-in-historic-move-to-restore-western-values/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1498435200000}, "source": "http://news4everyday.com"}, {"title": "ProLifers Declare Ejaculation Is Murder Every Sperm Cell Is A Life", "text": "The pro-life movement in the USA have stated that they believe that human life starts at the moment of conception and so the human fetus can be considered a human being, and hence they should have their rights to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, another argument broke out last month which has created a huge debate regarding abortion. Different religious groups have different views on this topic. Pro-lifers have stated that they believe that ejaculation is equivalent to murder and there should be laws to stop that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel Stratt, a pro-life activist commented that conception is the starting point of life, and that is why they don't believe in birth control. According to them, semen has been provided by the Almighty for a particular purpose to seed life and wasting it is simply showing your disrespect towards God. They believe that every sperm cell is life, and ejaculation means killing all those babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pro-life protesters are now asking the government to make a law which would make ejaculating for own gratification illegal throughout the USA. So many lives are lost only because men ejaculate watching p0rn videos on adult sites like Pornhub just to satisfy themselves. This is murder, there is an urgent need to protect the sperms, and the babies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a petition was submitted on Change.org stating that sperm wastage due to self-satisfaction should be made illegal, and it has already received over 85,000 signatures. It needs another 15,000 signatures before the White House will be reviewing it. 38 women who are in the White House reported that this bill would be passed if that opportunity ever arises."}, {"top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg", "text": "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.\n\nIt looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person\u2019s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn\u2019t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.\n\nFact-checking largely didn\u2019t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don\u2019t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.\n\nCNN has also released a statement: \u201cThe RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.\u201d But that still doesn\u2019t really verify that anything occurred.\n\n@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\n@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\nThe appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It\u2019s a layup for body-part puns.\n\nThis is exactly how fake news spreads\n\nBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it\u2019s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.\n\nThe stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded.", "authors": ["Lea Vat Kens"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news", "generator": "WordPress 4.8", "og": {"site_name": "Newslo", "description": "\u201cNext thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights\u201d", "title": "Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because \u201cSanta Was Always White In The Bible\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430-150x150.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-12-03T18:33:59+00:00", "url": "http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 395152810558131}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newslo1", "section": "Featured", "published_time": "2016-12-03T18:29:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-12-03T18:33:59+00:00"}, "verifyownership": "b03b12e9fdf4f032d48fc78bfadcdc32", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/", "images": ["http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dakota_Meyer_with_President_Obama-150x150.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thousands_protest_against_anti_gay_Charles-Worley-150x150.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/school.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430-645x325.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/130729170454-lead-intv-ted-cruz-full-00060416-story-top-150x150.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg", "http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg"], "title": "Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because \u201cSanta Was Always White In The Bible\u201d", "url": "http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1480789769000}, "source": "http://politicono.com"}, {"top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/city-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pist.jpg?fit=300%2C169", "text": "PRETORIA \u2013 South African Paralympic gold medallist, Oscar Pistorious hanged himself in his prison cell where he was serving a jail term for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, prison officials said on Saturday.\n\nPistorious, 30, was a celebrated Olympian and Paralympic gold medalist before fatally shooting his girlfriend Reeva on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2013.

The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201d\n\nAs Fox news reported

In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: \u201cYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain\u201d (Exodus 20:7). The word \u201cvain\u201d means \u201cfor no reason\u201d or \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God\u2019s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.\n\n\u201cDr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that \u201cin this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying the Lord\u2019s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,\u201d Hagee elaborated. \u201cBut, that\u2019s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don\u2019t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.\u201d\n\nThe pastor reprimanded: \u201cBut, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.\u201d\n\nAsked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you\u2019re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God\u2019s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord\u2019s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God\u2019s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker\u2019s good name.\u201d/religionlo.com/\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "USPOLN", "description": "\u201cOne of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord\u2019s name in vain.

It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.\n\nAmericans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.\n\nCruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201d\n\nCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201d\n\nAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201d\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\n\u201cImpeach!\u201d It\u2019s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word \u2013 long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the \u201cI\u201d word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked \u201cWatergate.\u201d\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left\u2019s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America\u2019s new Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,\u201d says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. \u201cNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I\u2019m not going to stop asking them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans\u2019 tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. \u2026 Resign now.\u201d\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned \u201cimpeachment\u201d enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, there\u2019s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\n\u201cThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,\u201d Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless \u201cgotcha\u201d announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence \u201ccorruptly\u201d when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted \u201cwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.\u201d Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. \u201cIf you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a fact.\u201d\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president\u2019s power, or in other words, its limitations \u2013 if they exist \u2013 Spicer argued that the Constitution \u201cclearly states\u201d what the President of the United States can and cannot do. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cone must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn\u2019t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president\u2019s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn\u2019t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.\u201d\n\nSpicer continued, \u201cAs a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there\u2019s a real need to follow the aforementioned \u2018if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president\u2019 rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that\u2019s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Spicer concluded./politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.1", "og": {"site_name": "USPOLN", "description": "During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors.

After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster\u2019s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide.\r\n.\r\nWith new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn\u2019t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide.\r\n.\r\nLT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital\u2019s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.\r\n.\r\nThe doctor who signed Foster\u2019s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice.\r\n.\r\nThe case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster\u2019s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau\u2019s resources are made available.\r\n.\r\nIn other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder\u2026again."}, {"top_img": "http://proudleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/25602642832_4ae1e69452_b.jpg", "text": "Need more proof that liberalism is a disease?

Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.\n\nAccording to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men\u2019s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It\u2019s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:\n\n\u201cTheir plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a \u2018design for a new video game,\u2019\u201d said Special Agent George Ketterman, \u201cWhile they never actually used the president\u2019s name or purchased any of the items listed in the \u2018game,\u2019 like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.\u201d\n\nIn unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.\n\nNBC News tried to reach out to the men\u2019s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn\u2019t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.\n\nWelcome to Trump\u2019s America, liberals.
