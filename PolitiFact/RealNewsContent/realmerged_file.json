Don\u2019t even read further if you are part of the man\u2019s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year.\n\nYou can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung\u2019s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What\u2019s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nLocal people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.\n\nMany people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung\u2019s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.\n\nLoung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.\n\nA dog lover\u2019s club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Loung\u2026hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "og": {"site_name": "John Hawkins' Right Wing News", "description": "Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.

She\u2019ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.\n\nClinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2014an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she\u2019s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump\u2019s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt\u2019s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.\n\nKeeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama\u2019s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.\n\nBut none of this compares to the degree to which this year\u2019s race is defined by global affairs \u2013 the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.\n\nClinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn\u2019t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very concerned,\u201d said a Clinton aide. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he\u2019s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nCertainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water\u2019s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIt will have lasting impact,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee\n\n\u201cIt has been changed,\u201d agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. \u201cIt gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.\u201d\n\nThere has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump\u2019s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico\u2019s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America\u2019s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that\u2019s hardly all.\n\nThere was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he\u2019s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.\n\nAnd just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of \u201cplaying into the hands\u201d of ISIL.\n\nOfficials openly wonder what Clinton\u2019s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?\n\nWhile many in Washington\u2019s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.\n\nHer meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they\u2019re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.\n\nTake Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump\u2019s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it\u2019s important from a policy standpoint,\u201d the aide said.\n\nIf Trump wins, he\u2019ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.\n\n\u201cThey will certainly want to see where we\u2019re coming from,\u201d King said. \u201cHe will have to clarify and make it clear where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nIf Clinton wins, she\u2019ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.\n\nCardin, who\u2019s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump\u2019s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if Trump were president and we\u2019re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of problems that have now been caused.\u201d\n\nThis has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he\u2019s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn\u2019t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.\n\n\u201cIt's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,\u201d said a senior administration official. \u201cSo that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.\n\nHe\u2019ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.\n\nBut the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn\u2019t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn\u2019t run her meetings this week by the White House either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a serious debate,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama\u2019s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. \u201cWe\u2019re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Edward-isaac Dovere", "Nahal Toosi", "Politico Staff", "Jack Shafer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Bucking tradition, Clinton and Trump take their campaigns to world leaders.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Bucking tradition, Clinton and Trump take their campaigns to world leaders.", "title": "America's relationships are on the line \u2014 no matter who wins", "url": "http://politi.co/2cx34yw", "image": "http://static.politico.com/29/1a/eabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9/160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/americas-relationships-are-on-the-line-no-matter-who-wins-228342", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/29/1a/eabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9/160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/73cde89/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F29%2F1a%2Feabf6f8b423ab495795f08d11ed9%2F160918-united-nations-gettyimages-606517178-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "America's relationships are on the line \u2014 no matter who wins", "url": "http://politi.co/2d1xPwp", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474261890000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "text": "Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:\n\nIn a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community\u201d and \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Trump responded by proposing that \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. \u201cI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,\u201d Trump told the questioner.\n\nStop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.\n\nWhen the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\nFormer US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as \u201cdestructive\u201d in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:\n\n\u201cIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via Flickr", "authors": ["Oliver Willis"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Oliver Willis", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This policy has been proven to be racist, and Trump wants it in every state.", "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "criminal justice, Donald Trump, police, race, racism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/28742365173_c4b99c39d8_k.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a922443535caa967b15e18639ed76c4?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-this-racist-policy-to-be-forced-on-every-state/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474416000000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Capture-15.jpg", "text": "Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a \u201cconcentrated Satanic attack?\u201d Yeah? Well, you aren\u2019t alone. But good news folks, you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already.\n\nScott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a \u201cnationally known\u201d preacher warned him \u201cthat if you choose to run for president, there\u2019s going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said there\u2019s going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that you\u2019ve never seen before and I\u2019m watching it every day,\u201d Scott said.\n\nScott\u2019s wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit:\n\n\u201cGod we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J.

But in this case it\u2019s not Donald Trump. It\u2019s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.\n\nLike Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia\u2019s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump\u2019s strongest states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49\u201331 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 51 percent in the state\u2019s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.\n\nThat\u2019s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia\u2019s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It\u2019s very nearly the opposite of what\u2019s happening in other states with close races.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it\u2019s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThis is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.\u201d\n\nIn this race, Trump isn\u2019t a drag on Republicans; he\u2019s an asset.\n\nThe reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It\u2019s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia\u2019s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.\n\nCole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he\u2019s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.\n\nIn a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,\u201d says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cIf you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known\u2014the wall, universal health care, the coal industry\u2014but so much of what\u2019s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.\u201d\n\nJustice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He\u2019s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won\u2019t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole\u2019s claim that he supports Obama as \u201ccomplete dog snot.\u201d\n\nAnd while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate \u201cisn\u2019t focused on the national political circus,\u201d the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. \u201cJim is no politician,\u201d says Herring. \u201cHe is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.\n\nMany doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. \u201cDo I think Justice has a lead? Yes,\u201d says Gates. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s double digits? No.\u201d\n\nSome of that is because Justice\u2019s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP\u2019s otherwise effective \u201cwar on coal\u201d messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he\u2019s voting for Trump, says voters don\u2019t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. \u201cShe said she\u2019s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don\u2019t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says one Democratic strategist.\n\nBut Saunders doesn\u2019t have kind words for Justice either: \u201cHe\u2019s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.\u201d\n\nCole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice\u2019s business record over the next several weeks. \u201cJim Justice is a coal operator, but he\u2019s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,\u201d Gates says. \u201cHis legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.\u201d\n\nThat record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice \u201cstands out\u201d among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.\n\nThe problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice\u2019s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That\u2019s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.\n\nThe pattern apparently extends to Justice\u2019s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.\n\nJustice\u2019s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.\n\nBoth Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that\u2019s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, West Virginia\u2019s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.\n\nMines sit idle as a string of industry giants\u2014 Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy\u2014filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it\u2019s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.\n\nThe coal industry\u2019s struggles haven\u2019t just hurt West Virginia\u2019s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.\n\nJustice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he\u2019s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints\u2019 training camp to the Greenbrier.\n\nIn late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\nJustice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier\u2019s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.\n\nWhether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor\u2019s race from \u201cLeans Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,\u201d Kondik says.\n\nTrump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor\u2019s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That\u2019s why Cole\u2019s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn\u2019t matter, so long as they\u2019re not voting for Justice.\n\nIn his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: \u201cAt the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what\u2019s best for Jim Justice.\u201d\n\nThat line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what\u2019s in Justice and Trump\u2019s best interests is in theirs, too.\n\nMason Adams writes from southwest Virginia.

Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they\u2019re looking \u2014 a screener.

Their scanners and pat-down agents don\u2019t do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that they\u2019ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through.

The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.\n\nAnd, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.\n\nWith four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.\n\n\n\nHear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:\n\nWhat's changed?\n\n-- Iowa (6) moves from from \"battleground\" to \"lean Republican\"\n\n-- Utah (6) moves from \"lean Republican\" to \"solid Republican\"\n\n-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\"\n\n-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground\"\n\nRoad to 270: Electoral College map\n\nNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.\n\nThe state of play\n\nDonald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up \"battleground\" category into the \"lean Republican\" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.\n\nThat leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nMaine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground,\" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.\n\nFinally, Utah moves back from \"leaning Republican\" to being solidly being in Trump's column.\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.\n\nFor all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.\n\nIt is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.\n\nThat's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.\n\nClinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.\n\nSolid Republican:\n\nAlabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6)West Virginia (5), Wyoming (3) (163 total)\n\nLeans Republican:\n\nArizona (11), Georgia (16), Iowa (6), (33 total)\n\nBattleground states:\n\nFlorida (29), Nevada (6), Ohio (18), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), North Carolina (15) (70 total)\n\nLeans Democratic:\n\nColorado (9), Michigan (16), New Hampshire (4), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10), (72 total)\n\nSolid Democratic:\n\nCalifornia (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)", "authors": ["Cnn Political Director", "David Chalian"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "CNN has updated its ratings of battleground states.

LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.\n\nAccording to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, \u201cCary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building.

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large\u2014up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.\n\n\u201cOh, the Panic of 1857,\u201d the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. \u201cIt was really bad. The president didn\u2019t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that\u2014whoever the winner is\u2014he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.\n\nBut Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won\u2019t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I\u2019ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let\u2019s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques\u2014stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn\u2019t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.\n\nBuchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.\n\nStart with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America\u2019s great financial downturns.\n\nFor a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.\n\nThen the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad\u2014Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade\u2014but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.\n\nThree days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.\n\nScott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.\n\nBuchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.\n\nIgnoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.\n\nLegend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that\u2014and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.\n\nTwo days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.\n\nHistorically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court\u2019s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country\u2014with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.\n\nAs appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.\n\nThousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned\u2014his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.\n\nEvery bank in New York City effectively closed\u2014none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.\n\nBuchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.\n\nThe residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.\n\nYet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and \u201cdeserved the gambler\u2019s fate.\u201d Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.\n\nIn a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.\n\nThroughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.\n\nIn other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker\u2019s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal\u2014except to one pig\u2014battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.\n\nAs the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn\u2019t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.\n\nThe Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln\u2019s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan\u2019s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.\n\nAs the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members\u2014he had a lot of Southern allies\u2014and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.\n\nEnter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms\u2019 speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the \u201cWorst. President. Ever,\u201d there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.\n\nToday, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of \u201908 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.\n\nRobert Strauss is author of the forthcoming Worst.

The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.\n\n\"I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,\" Trump said Monday on Fox News. \"I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.\"\n\nHe later said, \"I've already met with a couple,\" but refused to say which ones.\n\nClinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.\n\nClinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.\n\nWhile reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the \"path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.\"\n\nTrump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed \"the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,\" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.\n\n\"Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,\" the Trump campaign said.\n\nThe Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his \"high regard for peace-loving Muslims,\" the campaign added.\n\nThe campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship \"vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.\"\n\nSisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.\n\nSitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily \"the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression.\" Clinton added that she was \"anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.\"\n\nClinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.\n\n\"If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,\" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. \"While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.\"\n\nThe meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.\n\nTrump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto earlier this year.\n\nThe meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.\n\nClinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's \"embarrassing international incident.\"\n\n\"When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,\" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.\n\nInstead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.\n\nClinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.\n\nClinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian \"aggression\" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.\n\nCurrently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.\n\nClinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.\n\nClinton, according to an aide in the room, \"emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress\" and \"discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.\"\n\nClinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.\n\nClinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nSisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who \"recognize that this ideology of death\" must be extinguished.\n\nClinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.\n\nClinton, according to an aide, discussed \"the threat from North Korea\" and \"relations with China\" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.\n\nThere is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.", "authors": ["Jim Acosta", "Stephen Collinson", "Dan Merica"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.", "pubdate": "2016-09-19T12:32:35Z", "author": "Stephen Collinson, Dan Merica and Jim Acosta, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.", "pubdate": "2016-09-19T12:32:35Z", "title": "Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/trump-clinton-egypt-fattah-el-sisi/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140608062155-abdel-fattah-el-sisi-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140608062155-abdel-fattah-el-sisi-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-vls-col,col-donald-trump", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/trump-clinton-egypt-fattah-el-sisi/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons -

It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.\n\nSo what\u2019s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump\u2019s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, which was Clinton\u2019s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions\u2014from his announcement speech on\u2014the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump\u2019s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters\u2014and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought\u2014do not hear him the way those of us who\u2019ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he\u2019s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf he\u2019s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.\n\nMeasured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is \u201cunfit\u201d for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.\n\nAnd what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.\n\nOn the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then \u2026 the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the \u201cbirther\u201d issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his \u201cdefenses\u201d\u2014that he \u201dtook advantage of the laws of the nation\u201d in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes\u2014were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It\u2019s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that \u201cthe people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\u201d\n\nMoreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out \u201cracist:\u2019 charging he\u2019d \u201cstiffed\u201d many of those who\u2019d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)\n\nFinally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the \u201clook\u201d of a president\u2014a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of \u201cstamina,\u201d a smiling Clinton was ready.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cas soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d\n\nThat worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it\u2019s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I\u2019m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Jeff Greenfield"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The GOP candidate has defied the ordinary rules all along and still come out on top.

Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.\n\nStill, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic \u2014 Cuba-U.S. relations \u2014 that has increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.\n\nDeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee.\n\n\"The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,\" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.\n\nAmong those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\n\"Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,\" Flake tweeted.\n\nBut although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.\n\nAsked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.\n\n\"A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,\u201d the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.\n\nRubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.\n\n\"This nomination,\" Rubio said, \"should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nahal Toosi"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Jeffrey DeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission in Havana since 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Jeffrey DeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission in Havana since 2015.", "title": "Obama nominates ambassador to Cuba in long-shot move", "url": "http://politi.co/2dpvG29", "image": "http://static.politico.com/2d/3e/b3dc88fb4cf5b65868467ea04221/160927-jeffrey-delaurentis-getty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-nominates-ambassador-to-cuba-in-long-shot-move-228810", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/827971d/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F2d%2F3e%2Fb3dc88fb4cf5b65868467ea04221%2F160927-jeffrey-delaurentis-getty-1160.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/2d/3e/b3dc88fb4cf5b65868467ea04221/160927-jeffrey-delaurentis-getty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Obama nominates ambassador to Cuba in long-shot move", "url": "http://politi.co/2dqcRvf", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474996450000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160927085616-trump-clinton-debate-interjection-00002018-780x439.jpg", "text": "Monday night was the most-watched debate in American history.\n\nWell over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live.\n\nMany millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web.\n\nNielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\n\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\n\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\n\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\n\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\n\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\n\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\n\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\n\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\n\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\n\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\n\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\n\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\n\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the \"most tweeted debate ever.\"\n\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\n\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers.

Twitter said the \"final share of conversation around the candidates on stage\" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\n\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\n\nBeing talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\n\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\n\nCNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, presidential debate, debate, first presidential debate, first debate", "title": "Debate breaks record as most-watched in U.S. history", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was far higher rated than the first debates in 2008 and 2012, preliminary data shows.", "title": "Debate breaks record as most-watched in U.S. history", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/27/media/debate-ratings-record-viewership/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160927085616-trump-clinton-debate-interjection-00002018-780x439.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "media", "author": "Brian Stelter", "vr": {"category": "media", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-27T10:26:50", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, presidential debate, debate, first presidential debate, first debate", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "date": "2016-09-27 10:26:50", "twitter": {"description": "The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was far higher rated than the first debates in 2008 and 2012, preliminary data shows.", "title": "Debate breaks record as most-watched in U.S. history", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/27/media/debate-ratings-record-viewership/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160927085616-trump-clinton-debate-interjection-00002018-540x304.jpg", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was far higher rated than the first debates in 2008 and 2012, preliminary data shows."}, "canonical_link": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/27/media/debate-ratings-record-viewership/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150529102155-anheuser-busch-drinking-water-124x70.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/authors/byline-icon/brian-stelter.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/9.0/sections/media/cnnmedia_color.svg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828124254-hurricane-harvey-damage-124x70.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=731697573629176&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/cnn-logo.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160927020119-clinton-trump-debate-00001528-1024x576.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828120549-whole-foods-price-drop-bananas-124x70.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/sections/media/reliable-sources-cnnmoney.png", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/money-logo.png", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160927085616-trump-clinton-debate-interjection-00002018-780x439.jpg"], "title": "Debate breaks record as most-watched in U.S. history", "url": "http://cnn.it/2dwwCh9", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}, {"top_img": "http://conservativetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/arpaio-mccain-592x331.jpg", "text": "McCain Criticized Trump for Arpaio\u2019s Pardon\u2026 Sheriff Joe Fires Perfect Response Joe Arpaio may not be in office any more, but that doesn't mean America's toughest sheriff has lost his step... check out how he eviscerated John McCain after McCain attacked Donald J.

Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.\n\nThe good news is that Toby Keith didn\u2019t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren\u2019t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern.\n\nBoth Keith\u2019s managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets.\n\n\u201cThis is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond\u2026We understand the growing concerns for Toby\u2019s fans and our own fans, as we\u2019ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days\u2026It would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.\u201d\n\nThe rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time.\n\nToby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.\n\nI\u2019m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen.

And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor.\n\nOne of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. \u201cNo-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,\u201d Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: \u201ca bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nGot that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group.\n\nHowever, he also added that, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. We\u2019re not going to let them instill fear.\u201d\n\nOkay \u2013 so Cuomo admitted he/we don\u2019t know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but we can\u2019t let THEM win. If he/we don\u2019t know who the bomber is \u2013 may I ask who THEM is?\n\nKnowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens \u2013 is the definitely \u201cnot ISIS\u201d exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tie Obama\u2019s mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? I don\u2019t know, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\n\nThe Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less.\n\nIt is not hard to say \u2013 terrorism, unless you\u2019re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn\u2019t bring himself to utter the word.

But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%).

In turn, Republicans would provide an \"iron-clad commitment\" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLate Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.\n\n\"The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,\" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.\n\nPelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.\n\nWith Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.\n\nEarlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure \u2014 which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 \u2014 because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.\n\nMcConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.\n\n\"We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,\" McConnell said. \"That's certainly an option worth discussing.\"\n\nInformed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.\n\nBut other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. \"If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.\n\n\u201cThere's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,\u201d Durbin added.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. \u201cI doubt that we would turn that down,\u201d he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.\n\nSenate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWhy do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood \u2014 sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out \u2014 for Flint when there\u2019s a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?\u201d argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.\n\nStill, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.\n\nMcConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.\n\nAmong the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.\n\nThirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.\n\nHeather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Annie Snider contributed to this story.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Seung Min Kim", "Ben Weyl", "John Bresnahan", "Nahal Toosi", "Glenn Thrush"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill.", "title": "McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse", "url": "http://politi.co/2dp0rEo", "image": "http://static.politico.com/2c/7b/865c117e4568915dfa8aa080a4f9/160928-paul-ryan-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/congress-plan-no-government-shutdown-228794", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/2c/7b/865c117e4568915dfa8aa080a4f9/160928-paul-ryan-ap-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/7517376/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F2c%2F7b%2F865c117e4568915dfa8aa080a4f9%2F160928-paul-ryan-ap-1160.jpg"], "title": "McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6WORj", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474982464000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160915124911-donald-trump-jr--super-tease.jpg", "text": "Story highlights The tweet took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week\n\n\"We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,\" Trump said\n\nBoise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was \"trying to point out things that have to be said.\"\n\n\"People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,\" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. \"For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy.

Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren.\n\nThey talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles \u2013 especially the black ones \u2013 serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun they don\u2019t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it\u2019s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time.\n\nWhile these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is \u2013 she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! She doesn\u2019t want guns. Let\u2019s see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.\u201d\n\nEvery gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But they don\u2019t want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right.\n\nFor now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they\u2019d be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "authors": ["Philip Hodges", "View All Posts"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "\"I think they should disarm immediately.

former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that he\u2019d have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week.\n\n\u201cFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Beck said on his radio show.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Beck continued. \u201cI should have said: \u2018You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there\u2019s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he\u2019s kind of a politician, but he\u2019s a different kind of politician. He\u2019s a young politician. He\u2019s a Hispanic, He can win. Let\u2019s go for it.\u2019\"\n\nInstead, Beck sought \u201ca truly honorable man\u201d in Cruz \u2014 \u201cand that will always let you down,\u201d he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,\u201d Beck said. \u201cHe is just a politician first. I\u2019ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that\u2019s my fault. He is a politician.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.\n\nAfter Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).\n\n\u201cSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross \u2014 it\u2019s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, \u2018Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,\u2019 I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it\u2019s a binary choice?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,\u201d Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.\n\nBeck, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cThis is information that you had in Cleveland \u2014 and hang on just a second before you respond \u2014 you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSo you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: \u2018Oh, my gosh, he\u2019s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there\u2019s a reason to believe him.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his \u201csignificant disagreements\u201d with Trump, Cruz said, it\u2019s a binary choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for new information. I\u2019m asking you for new information,\u201d Beck said. \u201cYou knew all the things that you\u2019re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What\u2019s new?\u201d\n\nCruz pointed to the Trump campaign\u2019s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAfter Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. \u201cNow, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising \u2018I will nominate from these 21,\u2019 I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that\u2019s a clear choice.\u201d\n\nCruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he\u2019s always been \u201cNever Hillary\u201d but not ever \u201cNever Trump.\u201d He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBoth of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz\u2019s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. \u201cHe could have come on and said, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,\u2019 and I know that, because so are mine,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they\u2019re all saying I\u2019ll never fund \u2014 I won\u2019t fund you for the Senate. I won\u2019t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?\u2019\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D", "Shane Goldmacher"],

SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Mike Pence said there is too much talk of \"institutional racism and institutional bias\" in the wake of unrest following police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Police officers are human beings,\" Pence said at a pastors' roundtable at Radiant Church here. \"And in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPence said that police officers are \"the best of us.\"\n\n\"We ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias,\" he said, calling such assertions \"rhetoric of division.\"\n\nAsked by Bishop John Brannon, who is African-American, what Pence would \"personally do\" to heal divides in the country, Pence brought up the recent shootings.\n\n\"When there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld,\" Pence said.\n\nPence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that \"there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us.\"\n\nAt a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, Pence used the same line \u2014 that there is too much talk of \"institutional racism\" \u2014 to take aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"But in the wake of these tragic events in Tulsa and Charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement,\" Pence said. \"We heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country.\"\n\nPence said people expect a \"thorough, immediate and transparent investigation\" in the wake of police shootings.\n\nPence went on to say that police are \"not a force for racism in America, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect.\"\n\nHe also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added \"there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property.\"\n\nTrump expressed his own concern about the Tulsa shooting on Wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was \u201cchoking\u201d under

distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn\u2019t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?\n\nHoward Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.\n\nDean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:\n\nNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.\n\nAnd considering he hasn\u2019t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.\n\nOf course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.\n\nDean\u2019s assertion is just that \u2014 an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she\u2019s not.\n\nIf this debate showed one thing, it\u2019s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.\n\nFeatured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Here come the 'offended' Trump supporters.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Here come the 'offended' Trump supporters.", "title": "Howard Dean ROASTS Trump Over Debate Sniffles: \u2018Coke User\u2019?

It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig\u2019s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump\u2019s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. \u201cHis assistant just couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin\u2019s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. \u201cAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, \u2018What on earth did I do?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cake looks really good,\u201d Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?\u201d Wendel asked him.\n\n\u201cKallstadt?\u201d Trump Junior replied, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Janosch Delcker"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "In the idyllic hamlet of Kallstadt, there once lived a man named Friedrich Trump.

Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by

governor has dropped a lawsuit asking a federal court to preserve the state's HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms.\r\n\r\nIn court documents Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory cited \"substantial costs to the State\" as one reason for dropping his lawsuit against the federal government, writing that it did not serve the \"interests of judicial economy and efficiency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBusinesses, performing artists and event organizers have boycotted the state since House Bill 2 was passed. In July, the NBA announced it was pulling its February All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement, \"We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.\"\r\n\r\nThis month, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference both moved championship sporting events out of the state.\r\n\r\nMcCrory sued the federal government in May, after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state. The Department of Justice countersued, seeking to ban enforcement on the grounds that the law is, as Lynch said at the time, \"impermissibly discriminatory.\"\r\n\r\nDid You Know It's Legal In Most States To Discriminate Against LGBT People?\r\nIT'S ALL POLITICS\r\nDid You Know It's Legal In Most States To Discriminate Against LGBT People?\r\nNorth Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People\r\nTHE TWO-WAY\r\nNorth Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People\r\n\"This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them \u2014 indeed, to protect all of us,\" Lynch said at a news conference.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina is also fighting another lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality. That suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed in March on behalf of Joaquin Carca\u00f1o, a 27-year-old transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is banned from using public men's restrooms under the law.\r\n\r\nSome local support for the law is waning, as well. After months of bad business news and widespread condemnation by other state governments, at least two state legislators who helped pass the law now want it repealed.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina state Sens. Tamara Barringer and Rick Gunn have both backed off their initial support for the law. Barringer says she voted for the law out of concern about \"safety and particularly privacy in bathrooms.\" But last week, she told NPR she has changed her mind:\r\n\r\n\"There's several factors that have changed my mind. It is having a tremendous adverse economic impact on the families of North Carolina. These are jobs. These are the way we support our families, the way we fund education.\r\n\r\n\"It is also creating the wrong impression of North Carolinians in the world or across the nation. Last week, I had the privilege of representing North Carolina on an education mission to Arizona State University.\r\n\r\n\"But at lunch, someone asked the question, 'Senator Barringer, what is this HB2 thing?' And that really caught me in my tracks, that, all the way across the country, someone is asking this.\r\n\r\n\"And then, finally, the other thing that has galvanized me is we have talked hundreds of hours... since April about HB-2. And yes, it is an important issue, but we need to move on to the business of North Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nMcCrory has said he still stands by the ideas in the law, which makes it illegal for local governments in the state to pass laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination. But his office said last week that the governor would repeal the law if the city of Charlotte repeals a local ordinance protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the Charlotte Observer.\r\n\r\nThat local ordinance, which never took effect because the state law overruled it, would have prevented businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Charlotte, and allowed people to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Sues DOJ Over LGBT Law; DOJ Sues Back \r\nTHE TWO-WAY\r\nNorth Carolina Sues DOJ Over LGBT Law; DOJ Sues Back\r\nThe Charlotte City Council considered such a repeal in May, but it was voted down. The city's mayor, Jennifer Roberts, said the issue of whether to repeal the ordinance will not be on the agenda when the city council meets Monday evening.\r\n\r\nWhile city leaders \"applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2,\" Roberts wrote in a statement Monday, she argued that Charlotte does not bear responsibility for the state law, noting the state Legislature can overturn it \"at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte.\""}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-609066588.jpg", "text": "Donald Trump constantly talks about how he\u2019ll \u201cmake America great again.\u201d He\u2019ll bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However, there\u2019s one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.\n\nWell, since Trump won\u2019t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it \u201cA Buyer\u2019s Guide For Donald Trump.\u201d While Donald Trump says that \u201cit\u2019s very hard to have apparel made in this country,\u201d or \u201cthey don\u2019t even make the stuff here. It\u2019s so hard to get.\u201d Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:\n\nHillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, here\u2019s all the places Trump can make ties:\n\nInstead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillary\u2019s website for a full list. In other words, Trump\u2019s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.\n\nThanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers\n\nTrump will hear about the issues GOP House members and Senators are working on in Congress\n\nWashington (CNN) Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.\n\nThe highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office.\n\nIvanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias.\n\nTuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Deirdre Walsh", "Cnn Senior Congressional Producer"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T14:18:58Z", "author": "Deirdre Walsh, CNN Senior Congressional Producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T14:18:58Z", "title": "Ivanka Trump to meet with women GOPers at RNC", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/ivanka-trump-female-republican-roundtable/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160721221030-14-rnc-gallery-0721-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160721221030-14-rnc-gallery-0721-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/ivanka-trump-female-republican-roundtable/index.html"}, "keywords": "Ivanka Trump, Republicans, Congress, Election 2016, US election, Trump vs Clinton, politics, Ivanka Trump to meet with female Republican Congress members - CNNPolitics", "lastmod": "2016-09-20T19:29:36Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160721221030-14-rnc-gallery-0721-super-tease.jpg", "description": "Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ivanka Trump to meet with women GOPers at RNC"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/ivanka-trump-female-republican-roundtable/index.html", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160721221030-14-rnc-gallery-0721-super-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913221113-ivanka-trump-september-13-2016-exlarge-169.jpg"], "title": "Ivanka Trump to meet with female Republican Congress members", "url": "http://cnn.it/2ddRwBq", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}, {"top_img": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913142054-pagliano-house-oversight-super-tease.jpeg", "text": "Story highlights The House Oversight panel voted 19-15 to hold Bryan Pagliano in contempt\n\nPagliano failed to show for a second hearing on Clinton's emails and private server\n\nWashington (CNN) Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them.\n\nThe panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear \"betrays a naked political agenda.\"\n\nHouse Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify.\n\n\"I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server.

He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.\n\nThe actor said Donald Trump is,\n\n\u201con to something because secretly everybody\u2019s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That\u2019s the kiss-ass generation we\u2019re in right now. We\u2019re really in a p***y generation. Everybody\u2019s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.\u201d\n\nHe went on,\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, those things weren\u2019t called racist,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then when I did \u2018Gran Torino\u2019 even my associate said, \u2018This is a really good script, but it\u2019s politically incorrect.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Good. Let me read it tonight.\u2019 The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, \u2018We\u2019re starting this immediately.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump\u2019s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican\u2019s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind.\n\nThe icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference,\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody\u2014instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don\u2019t spend what you don\u2019t have. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we are in right now. That\u2019s why people are saying, \u2018Why should I work? I\u2019ll get something for nothing, maybe.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate.\n\nEastwood\u2019s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don\u2019t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash.\n\nIt is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Clint Eastwood appears again!

stands guard as North Koreans wave flags and cheer during an aerial display, in Wonsan, North Korea. | AP Photo DOJ: Chinese company tried to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea\n\nA Chinese company and four of its employees accused of attempting to evade U.S. sanctions against North Korea were the target of a set of enforcement actions announced Monday morning by the Department of Justice.\n\nChinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. They are also charged with attempting to defraud the United States and conspiring to engage in international money laundering.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe charges arise from financial transactions using U.S. dollars between Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, which is under both U.S. and UN sanctions. Those transactions, according to the Justice Department, were conducted both by Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development as well as by \u201cnumerous front companies\u201d that it controlled.\n\nThe Justice Department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 Chinese bank accounts of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and its front corporations. Those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the Justice Department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the United States. Because the money was routed through the U.S., it falls under American jurisdiction, the department said.\n\nPressure has mounted on President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to crack down on China, North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nation\u2019s latest nuclear test earlier this month. Republicans and even Obama\u2019s own former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure China to enforce international sanctions against North Korea.\n\nRep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has specifically called on Obama to put to use the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who \"imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into North Korea\" or \"engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of North Korea or its senior officials.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blamed Clinton for North Korea\u2019s most recent nuclear launch. Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, labeled it \u201cone more example of Hillary Clinton's catastrophic failures as secretary of state,\" and added that \"Clinton promised to work to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication.\"\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Chinese trading company Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co.

Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points \u2013 vilifying Syrian refugees. \u201cThese attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country\u201d yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.\n\nHe later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: \u201cThink of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It\u2019s sickness, and it\u2019s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen \u2013 and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man\u2019s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.\n\nHe called the cops.\n\n\u201cI did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing\u2026I\u2019m from Sikh faith. I\u2019ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution\u201d said Bains to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely right \u2013 because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they\u2019re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains\u2019 actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.\n\nFor instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen\u2019s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign\u2019s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America \u2013 not refugee or immigrants.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.\n\nThe rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people\u2014women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of it,\u201d says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. \u201cThis whole county\u2019s very, very patriotic.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone\u2014history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\n\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina\u2019s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments\u2014223\u2014than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the \u201cNew South\u201d and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it\u2019s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\n\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor\u2019s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia\u2019s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion\u2014known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy\u2014Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\n\nThat ruling\u2014along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state\u2014prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. \u201cIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you\u2019re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country\u2014to learn the good, the bad and ugly,\u201d Poindexter says.\n\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\n\n\u201cEvery little statue\u2019s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,\u201d says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. \u201cAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they\u2019re using it for.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. \u201cMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,\u201d Whitaker says.\n\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. \u201cThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,\u201d he says.\n\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\n\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth\u2019s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. \u201cWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,\u201d Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so \u201cthere has been protection all along.\u201d\n\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\n\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don\u2019t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument\u2014a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. \u201cWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we\u2019re concerned about cost?\u201d\n\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. \u201cWe\u2019re on solid legal grounds to remove it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need four votes.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city\u2019s entire historic landscape.\n\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville \u201cby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.\u201d The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\n\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site\u2014the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\n\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It\u2019s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments\u2019 removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders\u2014such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. \u201cRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia\u2019s history,\u201d Jones said in a statement last summer.\n\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he\u2019s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s far better than tearing down the current ones.\u201d\n\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is \u201cirrelevant.\u201d \u201cThey need to be respected,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what we know today. That\u2019s why these monuments are important.\u201d\n\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. \u201cThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It\u2019s an amalgam of power and weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re meant to do work,\u201d Ayers says. \u201cThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways they\u2019re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls \u201cThe War Between the States.\u201d Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\n\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, \u201cwe just don\u2019t have a copy of the actual check.\u201d\n\nPoindexter says Franklin County \u201clost hundreds of its best men\u201d in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was \u201ca horrible process\u201d that had a big impact on the region.\n\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state\u2019s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter\u2019s efforts to save war monuments. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anybody pulling any monuments down,\u201d Stanley says.\n\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county\u2019s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\n\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge. \u201cTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\u201d\n\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society\u2019s website, \u201cSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\u201d\n\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he\u2019s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. \u201cHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,\u201d says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn\u2019t ready to surrender, either. He doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn\u2019t ruled it out. \u201cIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\u201d\n\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media \u2013 and they didn\u2019t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami\u2019s capture, he\u2019d dissed the NYPD for allowing \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d to interfere with catching terrorists.

But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.\n\nFeatured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Vera", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump thinks Americans are too dumb to remember what he said 9 minutes ago.", "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "2016 Election, Conservative, Donald Trump, GOP, law enforcement, nypd, police officers, Republican, terrorism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "images": ["http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.30-PM.png", "http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-10.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.26-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.43-PM.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5bed92dd30b770a447beb34165598d8?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.36-PM.png", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.20-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.59-PM.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.26.05-PM.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn\u2019t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS)", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/19/trump-gets-annihilated-on-twitter-after-he-pretends-he-didnt-just-trash-police-officers-tweets/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474243200000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}, {"top_img": "http://static.politico.com/de/81/860012d04380bd44f535b803dd5f/ap-6009260636.jpg", "text": "On the night of September 26, as the house lights dim in the Mack Complex at Hofstra University and the TV cameras go live, millions of Americans will be riveted to the scene. Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton\u2019s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?\n\nExperience suggests it\u2019s hard to make a positive breakthrough\u2014especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe\u2014a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.\n\nDespite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don\u2019t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters\u2019 impressions\u2014which matters on Election Day.\n\nFor both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds\u2014which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump\u2019s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.\n\n1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK\n\nFamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.\n\nOn September 26, at the candidates\u2019 first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.\n\nVideo: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question\u2014here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.\n\nDuring their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn\u2019t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.\n\n2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis\n\nA more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia\u2019s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.\n\nNeither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates \u201cstood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,\u201d wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.\n\nYears later, Ford admitted that \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.\n\n3. 1980: Carter\u2019s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious\n\nIn politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn\u2019t get that lesson.\n\nIn front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right\u2014someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.\n\nWhile Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: \u201cThere you go again,\u201d he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter\u2019s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.\n\n4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan\u2019s one-liner negate a serious weakness\n\nDuring 1984\u2019s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer \u201cthat he had flopped.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: \u201cNew Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?\u201d\n\nFortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: \u201cI will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.\n\n5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question\n\nPerhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.\n\nDukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: \u201cGovernor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\u201d\n\nReporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t Bernard, and I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\u201d\n\nIt was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. \u201cIt was a question about Dukakis\u2019s values and emotions,\u201d his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. \u201cWhen he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.\u201d\n\n6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question\n\nDuring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.\n\nRight before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap,\u201d Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.\n\nChecking the time would\u2019ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did\u2014during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates\u2014it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.\n\n7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush\n\nEntering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.\n\nDuring the first debate, Gore\u2019s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush\u2019s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat\u2019s plans for their \u201cfuzzy math,\u201d Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.\n\nAt the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore\u2019s action look odd as the audience laughed.\n\nDonna Brazile, who ran Gore\u2019s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but \u201con mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing \u2026 many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.\u201d\n\n8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry\n\nAfter the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn\u2019t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush\u2019s record.\n\nThough Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren\u2019t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, \u201cFaces of Frustration,\u201d viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush\u2019s angry looks on the right side.\n\n***\n\nAppearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.\n\nAnd on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nJulian E.

As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience \u2013 and sends a dire warning to the American people.\n\nThis man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:\n\n\u201cMy country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. \u201c\n\nAngell acknowledges Trump\u2019s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.\n\n\u201cI stick at a different moment\u2014the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, \u201cI always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.\u201d Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war\u2026I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at H\u00fcrtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded\u2026my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.\n\nFar too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict \u2013 or never learned them at all, as in Trump\u2019s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they\u2019ve served their purpose.\n\nTrump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle \u2013 negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, \u201cHow will I look?\u201d This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist\u2019s mirror for reassurance.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency:\n\nI will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President\u2014at last, a female leader of our own\u2014and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.\n\nHe saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House:\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama.

I had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. I went to a local coin shop, and as I idled over some of the display cases, I noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. Oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large\u2014up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.\n\n\u201cOh, the Panic of 1857,\u201d the owner said when I asked him about the change of size. \u201cIt was really bad. The president didn\u2019t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow that is inept presidential decision-making. During the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that\u2014whoever the winner is\u2014he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. And before the current candidates were known, the two most recent White House occupants, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.\n\nBut Obama and Bush can both take heart. And Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won\u2019t rank last. By my reckoning, that place belongs to James Buchanan, genial a man though he was. I\u2019ve made quite a study of him. My innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let\u2019s say, the lesser presidents. My father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of Franklin Pierce. Everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques\u2014stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. If I were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn\u2019t be about Washington or Lincoln, or even Silent Cal Coolidge. It would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.\n\nBuchanan, the only president from my native state, Pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.\n\nStart with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of America\u2019s great financial downturns.\n\nFor a long time before Buchanan, in effect, precipitated the Panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. There had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in Europe, the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and Western land. The great acquisition of land under President James Knox Polk, from Oregon to California to Texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. Railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move West into the new territories and states. Manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since Europe had quelled many of its hostilities and American items were cheaper than those on the Continent.\n\nThen the day before Buchanan took office, Congress passed what he wanted, the Tariff Bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad\u2014Buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade\u2014but made American manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.\n\nThree days later came the real fatal blow, though, the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which fell on the shoulders of Buchanan. The case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with Buchanan, of small Dickinson College, wanted it settled.\n\nScott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native Missouri, a slave state, but in the Northwest Territories, which were nonslave. After his master died, Scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. Buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the Union for good.\n\nBuchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five Southerners and four Northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. He and Taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the Appeals Court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.\n\nIgnoring the idea of separation of powers, though, Buchanan browbeat Robert Cooper Grier, another Dickinson alumnus and a justice from Pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which Taney would write. Eventually, a New York native, Justice Samuel Nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.\n\nLegend has it that Taney, on the Capitol stairs just before he gave Buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told Buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. Buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that\u2014and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.\n\nTwo days later, the decision came down. Taney castigated Scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. He also wrote that the Constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. Thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the Fugitive Slave Law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.\n\nHistorically, experts rate Dred Scott as the worst decision in the court\u2019s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country\u2014with not just Taney, but surely Buchanan, responsible for it.\n\nAs appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. Now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go West, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. Railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. By midsummer, no one could take a ride on the Reading, as Uncle Pennybags does in the Monopoly game, since the Reading Railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the Illinois Central. Several lines, like the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Fond du Lac Railroad in Wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.\n\nThousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. Senator William Seward, the leader of the new Republican Party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned\u2014his stock in the Illinois Central, promoted to him by his rival Democrat Stephen Douglas, was virtually worthless.\n\nEvery bank in New York City effectively closed\u2014none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. The oldest grain company in New York, N.H. Wolfe and Co., failed in August, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co.\n\nBuchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. Calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.\n\nThe residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by Dred Scott. Instead of promoting unity and opening up the West to more settlement, as Buchanan had thought, Dred Scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of Northern prosperity.\n\nYet the South did not succumb as badly. Its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in Europe. There was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the North exacerbating regional tensions. The relative good times in the South caused Northerners of all parties to further blame Buchanan for being a Southern lackey.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. He said the federal government could do nothing. In his Annual Message in December 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the Panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. The government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. He said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and \u201cdeserved the gambler\u2019s fate.\u201d Eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged American individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.\n\nIn a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young Americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.\n\nThroughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, Buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. When hostilities flared in Kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, Buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical John Brown. When later Brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, just 40 miles from Washington along the Potomac, Buchanan again diddled before consulting Robert E. Lee, who had fortuitously been home in Arlington on leave from his post in Texas. Lee quickly went to Harpers Ferry to capture Brown and quell the raid.\n\nIn other ventures, though, Buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. He caused chaos in Utah, quelling what he thought to be a Mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. He supported mercenary William Walker\u2019s forays to conquer Nicaragua and Guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of Paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his Southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. Then there was the little known Pig War, started when a settler along the Canadian border on the San Juan straits in the Northwest, shot a pig owned by the Hudson Bay Co. that wandered onto his property. A standoff ensued until Buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding Kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal\u2014except to one pig\u2014battle. This was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army, stretched as thin as could be.\n\nAs the election of 1860 came close, Buchanan refused to support the one Democrat who could win, Stephen Douglas, because he just plain didn\u2019t like him. That caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring Republican Abraham Lincoln the election.\n\nThe Southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between Lincoln\u2019s election and his inauguration in March, thus under Buchanan\u2019s watch. Buchanan took the unusual position that the Constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.\n\nAs the first half-dozen states seceded, Buchanan lost several Cabinet members\u2014he had a lot of Southern allies\u2014and refused entreaties by many, including former President John Tyler, who would himself become a Confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.\n\nMeanwhile, Buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the South, Fort Sumter.\n\nEnter Lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms\u2019 speeches as the greatest of presidents. Lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but I contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no James Buchanan, the \u201cWorst. President. Ever,\u201d there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for Abe Lincoln to climb.\n\nToday, George W. Bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the Iraq War and his presiding over the Crash of \u201908 and the beginning of the Great Recession. Obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. But as happened with Honest Abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump to shine.\n\nRobert Strauss is author of the forthcoming Worst.

Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the \"result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight\n\nMitch McConnell is playing hardball \u2014 forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.\n\nWith spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats \u2014 yet still isn\u2019t enough to get the minority party on board.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.\n\nThe new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday \u2014 which funds the government until Dec. 9 \u2014 also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.\n\n\u201cThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve just offered,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn\u2019t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\u201cTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. \"I haven\u2019t counted votes but our caucus isn\u2019t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.\"\n\nIt also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank\u2019s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn\u2019t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nYet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika \"with no political riders.\"\n\n\"While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,\" Nelson said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,\u201d Reid told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she\u2019s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It\u2019s really unfair to the American people.\u201d\n\nDuring her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, \u201cin my view, is not even worthy of a counter.

Chuck Schumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he\u2019s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on Tuesday. He\u2019s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\n\u201cThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to allocate our resources so they\u2019re meaningful to us and our candidates.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumer\u2019s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party\u2019s candidates and a reflection of Democrats\u2019 future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates\u2019 committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He\u2019s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that\u2019s projected to bring in \u201cupwards of another million,\u201d according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\n\u201cSchumer has been relentless,\u201d said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\n\u201cLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,\u201d McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer\u2019s colleagues won\u2019t rule out the possibility that he\u2019ll donate more to his party\u2019s Senate takeover effort.\n\n\u201cIf he thinks it will make a difference, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019s very calculating,\u201d said a Democratic senator. \u201cChuck will be there if you need him.\u201d\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to watch everything closely. It\u2019s my sense he\u2019s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,\u201d Stabenow said.\n\nThere\u2019s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some tough decisions, which haven\u2019t been made yet,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he\u2019ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,\u201d Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply don\u2019t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But \u201cit may not make a difference,\u201d the Texan added.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett", "Seung Min Kim", "John Bresnahan", "Brent Griffiths", "Michael Stratford"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The New York Democrat is transferring $1 million to Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The New York Democrat is transferring $1 million to Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.", "title": "Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6NFKA", "image": "http://static.politico.com/bc/62/02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655/160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/chuck-schumer-senate-democrats-228384", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/749a038/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F62%2F02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655%2F160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/bc/62/02cbcd444b10b9592c44f641b655/160919-chuck-schumer-gettyimages-539051960-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover", "url": "http://politi.co/2cYJWvx", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474348829000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://newsbake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Breaking-news.jpg", "text": "Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken.\n\nShe was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.\n\nTMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr\u2019s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.\n\nCarr\u2019s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.\n\n\u201cI was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter completing \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business \u201cCharmian Carr Designs\u201d and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected \u2013 especially after being hired by Michael Jackson.\n\nCarr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.\n\nShe brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.\n\nI can\u2019t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!\n\nRIP CHARMIAN CARR.", "authors": ["Nancy Wells"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewsBake", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newsbake.com/entertainment-news/tv/breaking-hollywood-legend-just-died-terrible-disease/", "article_author_name": "Nancy Wells", "image": "http://newsbake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Breaking-news-1024x546.jpg", "site_id": "6ff0012b336e4af10273fa97f0092cf4", "article_published_time": "2016-09-19T02:09:38+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2017-08-30T00:16:56+00:00", "keywords": "charmain carr, hollywood, sound of music, tv", "wp_version": "7.8.0.4"}, "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.5 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "NewsBake", "description": "Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken.

Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather was born \u2014 and from which he was later deported.\n\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half\u2019s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig\u2019s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump\u2019s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. \u201cHis assistant just couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin\u2019s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. \u201cAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, \u2018What on earth did I do?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cake looks really good,\u201d Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?\u201d Wendel asked him.\n\n\u201cKallstadt?\u201d Trump Junior replied, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Janosch Delcker"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "In the idyllic hamlet of Kallstadt, there once lived a man named Friedrich Trump.

Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscow\u2019s international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.\n\nAmidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed \"King of Hawaii,\" who called in via video link.\n\nAnd among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States.\n\nThe conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.\n\nThe conference\u2019s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to create a multi-polar world,\u201d the conference\u2019s creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. \u201cOur president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.\u201d\n\nIonov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.\n\nIonov\u2019s conference plays into Moscow\u2019s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part.\n\nAll that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlin\u2019s orbit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of awkward I guess,\u201d Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.\n\nABC News\n\nSmith\u2019s group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to have a dialogue. We\u2019re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.\u201d\n\nIt was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation.\n\n\u201cWe want to draw attention to our campaign,\u201d Marinelli said. \u201cWe\u2019re not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that.\"\n\nThe two secessionists\u2019 urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government is so dysfunctional it can\u2019t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,\u201d Marinelli said.\n\nBoth men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent \"Brexit\" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees.\n\nBut why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,\u201d Smith said.\n\nHowever, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscow\u2019s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding France\u2019s anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a school-book case,\u201d said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia\u2019s use of the far right. \u201cThe simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.\u201d\n\nKreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy.\n\n\u201cThe tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,\u201d Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy.\n\nFew of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s using everybody,\u201d Marinelli said. \u201cWe\u2019re using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ...\" he trailed off before finishing. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got their own agenda, right? So, that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\nFor most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference\u2019s oddity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,\u201d said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland.\n\nIn any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldn\u2019t let \u201cVladimir himself\u201d impose ideas on him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,\" he said.\n\nBesides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. \u201cMaybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,\u201d he said then paused, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that\u2019s what they think.\"", "authors": ["Abc News"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference", "description": "Meet the attendees of Moscow's international conference of separatists.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Meet the attendees of Moscow's international conference of separatists.", "title": "Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Meet the attendees of Moscow's international conference of separatists.", "title": "Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_16x9_992.jpg", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42395066", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42395066", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-27", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42395066", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42395066", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-27", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-27 17:34:13", "keywords": "Moscow, separatist, Russia, Moscow, Texas, California, conference, Ukraine, international news, world news, foreign news", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Moscow, separatist, Russia, Moscow, Texas, California, conference, Ukraine"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/texas-california-separatists-attend-pro-kremlin-conference/story?id=42395066", "images": ["http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_12x5_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_donetsk_peoples_republic_jef_160927_4x3_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ABC_marinelli_jef_160927_16x9_992.jpg"], "title": "Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2d7uFbf", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}, {"top_img": "http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpobama-2.png", "text": "24.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn\u2019t exist until President Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this \u2026 Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that\u2019s a big change, and I think that\u2019s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.\u201d\n\nThis perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance \u2013 blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.\n\nSupporting her candidate\u2019s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that \u201cif you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\u201d\n\nTo put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time\u201d and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans \u201cwere raised.\u201d\n\nIn one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.\n\nShe is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied \u201cI don\u2019t care, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nUPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.\n\nWatch it here \u2013 her remarks begin at 4:40:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

"http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trump-cuban.png", "text": "72k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.\n\nInstead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets \u2014 that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , \u201cIt sounds like you admitted you haven\u2019t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are \u2014 it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn\u2019t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that\u2019s been great to us. And you can\u2019t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump\u2019s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Express reports:\n\nJama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child\u2019s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.\n\nDuring the trial Jama B. boasted: \u201cI\u2019m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nJudge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: \u201cit was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.\n\n\u201cTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He\u2019s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nJama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.\n\nA second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nProsecutor Axel Bieler said, \u201cRape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.\n\n\u201cTherefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nSay what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.\n\nKarin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, \u201cThe court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,\u201d she added. \u201cHe is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is the comments by the family\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201cIt was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,\u201d Peter Boysen said. \u201cTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He\u2019s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\nReally, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not.\n\nGermans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.\n\n\u201cThe incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,\u201d wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. \u201cThis is the verdict that shames you all.\u201d\n\nPeople continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.\n\nDon\u2019t think it won\u2019t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they\u2019ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.\n\nIn a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily

that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo how exactly does a veto override work?\n\nThe rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber \"shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.\"\n\nIn other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first.\n\nBoth the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the \"yeas and nays\" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator\u2019s name is called by the clerk.\n\nThough the Senate received President Obama\u2019s veto message on Friday, they\u2019re not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor.\n\nThen, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, \"Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?\"\n\nWhile some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.\n\nAssuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue.\n\nIf the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.", "authors": ["Abc News", "More Ali"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "How Congress Can Override President Obama's Veto of the 9/11 Bill", "description": "How Congress Can Override President Obama's Veto of the 9/11 Bill", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\nSo how exactly does a veto override work?\nThe rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution.

NATO chief counterattacks against Donald Trump The alliance \u2018has been fighting terrorism for years,\u2019 says Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nBRATISLAVA \u2014 NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck back Tuesday at Donald Trump over the U.S. presidential candidate\u2019s claim that the Atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism.\n\n\u201cNATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it\u2019s not a result of the U.S. elections campaign,\u201d said Stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of European defense ministers in Bratislava.\n\nTrump, who has been critical of NATO and even gone so far as to question the U.S. membership of it, said Monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton that he now supported the alliance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for NATO,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they\u2019re going to do that. And that was \u2014 believe me, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to get credit for it \u2014 but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO\u2019s track record of fighting terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,\u201d he said, stressing that it was \u201cour biggest military operation ever.\u201d NATO \u201chas and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism\u201d and the organization has \u201cstepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg also said that NATO\u2019s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence \u201cwill also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.\u201d But he insisted the role is \u201csomething which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.\u201d", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The alliance \u2018has been fighting terrorism for years,\u2019 says Jens Stoltenberg.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The alliance \u2018has been fighting terrorism for years,\u2019 says Jens Stoltenberg.", "title": "NATO chief counterattacks against Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-counterattacks-against-donald-trump-jens-stoltenberg/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-1200x628.jpg", "height": 628}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "foreign-affairs,politics", "wp-parsely_version": "1.10.1", "article": {"published_time": "2016-09-27T13:22:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-30T09:46:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-counterattacks-against-donald-trump-jens-stoltenberg/", "images": ["http://allbritton.122.2o7.net/b/ss/allbrittonpoliticoeurope/1/H.27.5--NS/0", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Influence.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Florian-90x90-small.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-714x500.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20415958&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-601058656-1200x628.jpg", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Brexit_Files90x90.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-610600346-90x60.jpg", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sunday_Crunch_90x90.png", "http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ryan1.png"], "title": "NATO chief counterattacks against Donald Trump \u2013 POLITICO", "url": "http://politi.co/2d15Len", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474982556000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "text": "Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.\n\nAnderson\u2019s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a \u201croundabout\u201d way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.\n\n\u201cI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,\u201d Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country\u2019s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) \u2014 and if you\u2019ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his \u2018thing.\u2019 The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a \u201cprohibited immigrant\u201d:\n\nPastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana \u2014 Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016\n\nWhat prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be \u201cstoned to death.\u201d Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn\u2019t advocate violence, the victims were \u201cdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.\u201d\n\nAnderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn\u2019t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), \u201cif it did then yes I would condone it\u201d because \u201cthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country\u2019s acceptance of \u201cf*ggots,\u201d has called the Orlando massacre \u201cgood news\u201d because a bunch of \u201cf*ggots\u201d died (he later expanded on that by adding that \u201cperfect Christians\u201d would \u201cbathe\u201d in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world \u201cto cure AIDS.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll play it on repeat and laugh.\n\nYou can see an interview with his camera guy here:\n\nFeatured image via screen capture", "authors": ["John Prager"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "This made my day!", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "John Prager", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "This made my day!", "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be \u2018Stoned to Death\u2019 (VIDEO)", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This made my day!", "creator": "@EvilLiberalPig", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be 'Stoned to Death' (VIDEO)", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/iamyourknight"}, "keywords": "Africa, arrest, botswana, deportation, South Africa, stephen anderson", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e3249030ff74276709a1914c25ea3?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-5.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://addictinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be \u2018Stoned to Death\u2019 (VIDEO)", "url": "http://www.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/20/hateful-arizona-pastor-deported-from-botswana-after-saying-gays-should-be-stoned-to-death-video/", "summary": "", "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/okWisU--wys?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ev6IE12obr8?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474329600000}, "source": "http://www.addictinginfo.org"}, {"top_img": "http://static.politico.com/cb/e7/650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53/160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg", "text": "President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow, he\u2019s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama has cast the Saudis as \"so-called\" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to \"share\" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syria\u2019s bloody civil war.\n\nDespite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThat Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.\n\n\"This is clearly a relationship in transition,\" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Nobody really has a sense of what they\u2019re trying to transition it to.\"\n\nJust how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. \"Does no one sense the irony?\u201d asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.\n\nThe back and forth in Washington is \"schizophrenic behavior\" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.\n\nCongress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.\n\nAdministration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.\n\n\"To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.\n\nThe perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.\n\n\"We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,\" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. \"We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.\"\n\nWhatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.\n\nThe Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.\n\nIt deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's \"red line\" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.\n\nStill, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBut earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.\n\n\u201cThe competition between the Saudis and the Iranians \u2014 which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen \u2014 requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,\u201d Obama said.\n\nPrince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had \"thrown us a curve ball\" and criticizing the president for saying America\u2019s Gulf allies were \u201cfree riders\u201d wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.\n\nAnd in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd \"discussed\" and \"exchanged views\" more than agreeing on anything.\n\nThe president also hosted Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdom\u2019s image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.\n\nBut some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.\n\nThe low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing America\u2019s addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia \u2014 women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.\n\nBy all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.\n\n\"The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,\" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.\n\nIn many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.\n\nBoth Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump \u2014 who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States \u2014 as a wild card.\n\nFor now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.\n\nAlready, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington \u2014 a powerful one, but not popular,\" the former senior U.S. official said. \"And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett", "Heather Caygle", "Seung Min Kim", "John Bresnahan", "Nahal Toosi"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Long a critic, the president now finds himself in the uncomfortable spot of protecting the austere desert monarchy from Congress.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Long a critic, the president now finds himself in the uncomfortable spot of protecting the austere desert monarchy from Congress.", "title": "Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender", "url": "http://politi.co/2d7ZjEF", "image": "http://static.politico.com/cb/e7/650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53/160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-saudi-arabia-228521", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/9565d38/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fcb%2Fe7%2F650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53%2F160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/cb/e7/650b4f6e4601a63cd6b462ef0f53/160922-obama-saudi-ap-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender", "url": "http://politi.co/2deClfw", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474567134000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Derrick-Stafford.jpg", "text": "A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect\u2019s six-year old son.\n\nAnd Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:\n\n\u201cStafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.\u201d\n\nOfficers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.\n\n18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.\n\nThat\u2019s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it\u2019s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.\n\nReports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.\n\nStafford\u2019s plea of \u201cself-defense\u201d is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy\u2019s grieving family.

The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott\u2019s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn\u2019t armed and was only carrying a book.\n\nAs usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott\u2019s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another \u201cproof\u201d that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.\n\nAs it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there\u2019s no reason to think he wouldn\u2019t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:\n\nRakeyia Scott\u2019s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun\u2014even as he brandished a gun in front of them\u2014now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children\u2019s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they\u2019d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, \u201cHe is no longer a threat to me and my family.\u201d But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. \u201cHe said he is a \u2018killer\u2019 and we should know that,\u201d she wrote. She said the man she\u2019d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.\n\nThe Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah \u2013 OK.\n\nScott\u2019s wife told officers he didn\u2019t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could\u2019ve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, they\u2019re doing so over a man who could\u2019ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would\u2019ve been an accomplice to their murders.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Freedom Daily", "description": "He was armed - and dangerous.", "title": "TRUTH COMES OUT!

That\u2019s big news! It\u2019s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\u201d\n\nCNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied:\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that\u2019s the way it will continue to be.\u201d\n\nContinue reading below the advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFord has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there.\n\nSo once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That\u2019s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland\u2013states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin\u2013where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt.\n\nFeatured Image Via Business Trajectory\n\n80510 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest", "authors": ["View All Posts", "Follow On Twitter", "Visit Website"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Donald Trump told Fox News that Ford is moving all of its production to Mexico, but CEO Mark Fields says that is total bullsh*t.", "og": {"site_name": "portal.liberalamerica.org", "description": "Donald Trump told Fox News that Ford is moving all of its production to Mexico, but CEO Mark Fields says that is total bullsh*t.", "title": "Ford Motor CEO Says Trump Is Lying AGAIN!

Bloomberg is out with a poll this morning that tracks with practically every public survey that\u2019s been released: the race for the White House is basically tied. http://bloom.bg/2dlw162 Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in a four-way race, 43-41, and the two are tied with 46 percent in a head-to-head race.\n\nA NEW CNN poll has Hillary Clinton up one point -- 45-44 -- in Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump leads Clinton in Colorado 42-41. http://cnn.it/2dawOn3\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s with that backdrop that the nation turns to HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY on LONG ISLAND for the first matchup between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nThe debate begins at 9 p.m. and will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption. NBC\u2019s Lester Holt is the moderator -- he\u2019s done practically no press in the leadup to what could be the biggest moment of his career.

Rather than play it safe with milquetoast positions, Mrs. Clinton wants to increase turnout among African-Americans and women by tackling issues of bias and respect.

Slightly more Republicans than Democrats said the debates would be important to them, 37% to 31%.

Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\n\u201c1. Does he actually know - or care to know - the basic information needed to competently run the country? \u2026 2.

One reality they\u2019re unlikely to note: Whoever wins in November will enjoy far less latitude to spend money or cut taxes than any president since World War II.

Just six weeks after he dropped out \u2013 and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention \u2013 the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan\u2019s own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors. He charges more than $51,000 to ping his full email file of 1.28 million supporters.\u201d http://politi.co/2dvr5KK\n\nREMEMBERING ARNOLD PALMER -- \u201cArnold Palmer, the Magnetic Face of Golf in the \u201960s, Dies at 87,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Dave Anderson: \u201cArnold Palmer, the champion golfer whose full-bore style of play, thrilling tournament victories and magnetic personality inspired an American golf boom, attracted a following known as Arnie\u2019s Army and made him one of the most popular athletes in the world, died on Sunday, according to a spokesman for his business enterprises.

Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian \u2018hatred and violence\u2019 for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.\n\n\u201cNot to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, \u2018any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\u2019 \u2026 The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters. They also prompted complaints from Trump critics that Netanyahu was legitimizing Trump on the world stage.\u201d http://politi.co/2dvqQz7\n\nNYT EDITORIAL BOARD, part II -- \u201cWhy Donald Trump Should Not Be President: Donald Trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises\u201d: \u201cWhen Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican \u2018rapists\u2019 flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd\n\nAIR WARS -- \u201cCoal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign,\u201d by Josh Gerstein: \u201cFor the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C.

In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...\n\n\u201c[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative.

Charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. The police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer.\n\n\"These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,\" McCrory said Wednesday night on CNN shortly after making the announcement.\n\n\"We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,\" McCrory added. \"That is not the American way.\"\n\nThe North Carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained \"a very strong option.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, police officers saw Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun.

On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station.\n\nNew Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were \"certain commonalities among the bombs,\" leading authorities to believe \"that there was a common group behind the bombs.\"\n\n\"We want to get this guy in for questioning,\" de Blasio said on CNN. \"We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly.\"\n\nEarly Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that's tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured.\n\nSaturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.\n\n\"The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,\" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.\n\nCuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: \"Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this.\"\n\nThe White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday.\n\nOn Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped \"a vehicle of interest\" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.\n\nShe wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.\n\nNo one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said.\n\nCuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared \"similar in design\" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected.\n\nCellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured.\n\nThe bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Associated Press"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;We need to get this guy in right away,&quot; Bill de Blasio says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;We need to get this guy in right away,&quot; Bill de Blasio says.", "title": "28-year-old man sought in Manhattan blast", "url": "http://politi.co/2cYbq79", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c5/b5/f61c15304140a6613cfd47e22870/untitled-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/naturalized-afghanistan-citizen-sought-in-manhattan-blast-228351", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/c5/b5/f61c15304140a6613cfd47e22870/untitled-1.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/e21986e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc5%2Fb5%2Ff61c15304140a6613cfd47e22870%2Funtitled-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "28-year-old man sought in Manhattan blast", "url": "http://politi.co/2cjO7Ux", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474272304000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://static.politico.com/18/e6/96ceb10e4396bf2c18bfecfc3a22/gettyimages-522275182jpg.jpg", "text": "There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he\u2019s created. \u201cIs there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally?\u201d he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming \u201cTRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!\u201d That\u2019s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,\u201d a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn\u2019t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama\u2014\u201cWe call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?\u201d\u2014and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they\u2019re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.\n\nHis opponent does not. Clinton\u2019s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world\u2019s most famous and polarizing woman, but she\u2019s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.\n\nTonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven\u2019t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you\u2019re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game\u2014rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency\u2014and when 2016 is over, it\u2019s not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who\u2019s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d or \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The small venues are selected to target niche groups\u2014millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando\u2014and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very substantial, very specific,\u201d Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a \u201cHil Yes!\u201d pin to Clinton\u2019s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We\u2019re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\u201d\n\nClinton had better hope not. There\u2019s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can\u2019t match. It\u2019s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you\u2019re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It\u2019s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (\u201cIt\u2019s 100 degrees in here. And that\u2019s considered cool for an auditorium.\u201d) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell\u2014the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world\u2014then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump\u2019s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn\u2019t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton\u2019s campaign, like his accusations that it\u2019s \u201cpolicy-free,\u201d when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there\u2019s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches\u2014he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long\u2014with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\n\u201cBom. Bom. Bom. See ya!\u201d Trump smirked. \u201cSee ya! I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump\u2019s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he\u2019s shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I\u2019m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the \u201cbad, dishonest, very bad people\u201d in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word \u201csir\u201d to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as \u201ca big fat bubble,\u201d and predicted a collapse that would be \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: \u201cI didn\u2019t put him there! I\u2019m not paying him!\u201d He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself \u201cmore militaristic than anyone in this room,\u201d complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year\u2014actually the president\u2019s salary\u2014and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\n\u201cWhoever the hell brought this mic system\u2014don\u2019t pay the son of a bitch!\u201d he seethed. \u201cDon\u2019t pay em. Don\u2019t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn\u2019t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they\u2019ll pay, they don\u2019t care. So we\u2019re not going to pay. I guarantee, I\u2019m not paying for this mic.\u201d\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola\u2019s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: \u201cTyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and\u2026well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clich\u00e9s and Republican talking points about \u201cencrusted insiders\u201d and \u201cturning the page.\u201d He said the kind of things regular politicians say: \u201cThe history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.\u201d And: \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ll have a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd\u2014during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: \u201cWhat about white people?\u201d\u2014but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall\u2014but really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing \u201call the problems in the world,\u201d including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that \u201cpersonally, I think she\u2019s an unstable person,\u201d and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone \u201cright smack in the middle of the heart\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, OK?\u201d He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2014and then he had cozied up again: \u201cHe\u2019s been nice to me, and if he\u2019s nice to me, that\u2019s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that \u201cthe country is collapsing.\u201d\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We\u2019re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community\u2014which endured slavery and Jim Crow\u2014was \u201cin the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!\u201d Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline \u201cRestraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.\u201d Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton\u2019s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn\u2019t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn\u2019t make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasn\u2019t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it\u2019s that defiant you-can\u2019t-tell-me-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people\u2019s feelings, always watching our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, so it\u2019s cool to see him speak his mind,\u201d said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing\u2014he doesn\u2019t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn\u2019t stumble around like she did on the video\u2014Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: \u201cHe\u2019ll call a spade a spade, and if you don\u2019t like it you can shove it.\u201d Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. \u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we\u2019re offensive. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off\u2014at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn\u2019t want hate in their state: \u201cLazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!\u201d He explained to me that America was under siege, with \u201cthousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,\u201d and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition\u2014and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: \u201cWe want our state rights back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,\u201d says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don\u2019t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. \u201cTrump is saying what we\u2019re all thinking: \u2018Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don\u2019t end where your feelings begin!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as \u201cthe oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\u201d And he\u2019s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it\u2019s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll say it openly, and some people don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t really care: What do you have to lose?\u201d His long riffs about how he\u2019ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can\u2019t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don\u2019t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent\u2014the real rate is about one third of that\u2014he\u2019s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya\u2014and many I spoke to believe he\u2019s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. \u201cA lot of us who like him don\u2019t like the stuff he says about race,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cObviously, some do.\u201d\n\nThis really isn\u2019t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal\u2014a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams\u2014she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She\u2019s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn\u2019t been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton\u2019s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an \u201cInclusive Economy,\u201d to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters\u2014a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse\u2014about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton\u2019s concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a nice speech,\u201d Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. \u201cNot very exciting, but I believe she\u2019ll do what she says.\u201d\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: \u201cAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\u2019re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.\u201d Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. \u201cIn the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,\u201d Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children\u2019s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department\u2019s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she\u2019s known\u2014including the \u201cunbelievably good-looking\u201d actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that \u201cfamily values\u201d should mean that every family has value\u2014and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the \u201csub-minimum wage\u201d that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a \u201creally slow, vicious death\u201d to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn\u2019t feel bad if they\u2019re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton\u2019s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton\u2019s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn\u2019t even mention Trump\u2019s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down\u2019s Syndrome and lead a productive life. \u201cWhat Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,\u201d Kilsheimer said. \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she\u2019s got heart.\u201d\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton\u2019s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they\u2019re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren\u2019t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it\u2019s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump\u2019s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. \u201cMy daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We\u2019ve got plenty to lose,\u201d said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\u201d\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all Mexicans, and we\u2019re all bad,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they\u2019ll come out to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, I guess,\u201d said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. \u201cMy main worry is Trump\u2019s fingers on the nuclear code. But I\u2019d say she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they\u2019re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she\u2019s a typical lying politician, so they\u2019re voting for Trump\u2014and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they\u2019re staying home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s great on the issues, but it\u2019s hard to get people to focus on that.\u201d\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and recovery during Obama\u2019s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. \u201cWhen Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,\u201d said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. \u201cMan, Hillary should talk about that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn\u2019t focused on his policies, because they\u2019re so insubstantial and flexible, because he\u2019s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It\u2019s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump\u2019s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They\u2019ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump\u2019s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump\u2019s political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president\u2019s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can\u2019t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight\u2019s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won\u2019t be normal, but it won\u2019t be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though she\u2019s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo\u2014not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She\u2019s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn\u2019t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn\u2019t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they\u2019ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren\u2019t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they\u2019re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values\u2014showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren\u2019t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences\u2014that have constrained politicians in a good way. It\u2019s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they\u2019re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Michael Grunwald", "Daniel Strauss", "Kyle Cheney", "Daniel Lippman", "Michael Kruse", "M Scott Mahaskey", "Brent Griffiths", "Taylor Gee"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Want to understand what's really at stake tonight?

General Assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low.\n\nNo one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. While Kerry and Lavrov were set to hold more talks Friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point.\n\nAs the diplomats huddled in a New York hotel, Syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of Aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months.\n\nAccording to one official present in the gathering, Kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his BlackBerry. A furious Kerry then told the entire room, Lavrov included, that \"even while we are meeting here, they are doing this,\" said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.\n\nLavrov told Russian media that consultations would continue to \"guarantee\" the cease-fire.\n\nBut even as Kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad's Russian-backed government and U.S.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working.\n\n\"We can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open,\" Kerry told reporters. \"Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance.\"\n\nHe called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a Russian one earlier this week that the U.S. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians.

Shepard was known as the \u201cGrand Lady\u201d. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years \u2013 which is how she earned the name.\n\nThe Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for.\n\nOf course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn\u2019t the same as what it used to be.

At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she\u2019d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band\u2019s \u2018girl singer.'\u201d\n\nThere is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady.

delay'\n\nHillary Clinton called on authorities in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Friday to release the police video showing shooting of Keith Scott \"without delay.\"\n\nThe former of secretary of state, who made reforming the criminal justice system an early centerpiece of her campaign, wrote that \"we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides.\" The post was signed with her initial, H, indicating that the post was written personally by Clinton.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCell phone video showing the shooting released Friday by NBC News and The New York Times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him.\n\nThe video, recorded by Scott\u2019s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible. Keith Scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement.\n\nCharlotte police said Keith Scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on Tuesday. In the video, released by the victim\u2019s family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to \u201cdrop the gun\u201d while his wife shouts \u201che has no weapon\u201d and \u201che has no gun.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim\u2019s body.\n\nThe video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that he did not plan to release his department\u2019s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim\u2019s family and attorneys to view it.\n\nKeith Scott\u2019s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, Terence Crutcher, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. In Charlotte, those protests grew violent Wednesday night into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency. With National Guard troops looking on and a midnight curfew in effect, protests Thursday night were mostly peaceful.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Cristiano Lima", "Louis Nelson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The video, recorded by Scott\u2019s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The video, recorded by Scott\u2019s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible.", "title": "Clinton demands Charlotte police video release 'without delay'", "url": "http://politi.co/2cN6kIx", "image": "http://static.politico.com/fd/73/54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95/ap-16267600524055.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/keith-scott-shooting-video-228583", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/cf5aef9/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffd%2F73%2F54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95%2Fap-16267600524055.jpg", "http://static.politico.com/fd/73/54eec88c47908855e76a38813f95/ap-16267600524055.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Clinton demands Charlotte police video release 'without delay'", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6lgRT", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474637900000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "text": "Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it\u2019s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.\n\nData analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.\n\nContrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.\n\nNate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton\u2019s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times\u2019 election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.\n\nAgain, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.\n\nDemocrats shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.\n\nWith 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.\n\nRachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:\n\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!", "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "democrats, Donald Trump, early voting, FiveThirtyEight, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Nate Silver, New York Times, north carolina, Pat McCory, President Obama, Rachel Maddow", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605904012.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/23/early-voting-in-north-carolina-shows-great-news-for-democrats/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474588800000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}, {"top_img": "http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HillaryClintonPresidentObamaSpeakCongressional8q1feGkdgYFl-e1474244946994.jpg", "text": "Obama Claims It Will Be A Personal Insult If You Don\u2019t Vote For Hillary [VIDEO]\n\nThis past Saturday night our Divider-in-Chief was at it again.

Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn\u2019t vote for Hillary.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cMy name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that\u2019s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There\u2019s no such thing as a vote that doesn\u2019t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!\u201d\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nWe definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can\u2019t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You\u2019ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you\u2019ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it\u2019s a mess.\n\nThe Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for. So save the preaching for those who want to hear it.

Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton\u2019s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.\n\nWe should be clear that Walinsky\u2019s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.\n\nWalinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that America\u2019s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mind\u2014before excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.\n\nTo compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump is\u2014well, I won\u2019t finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.\n\nWalinsky quotes Robert Kennedy\u2019s statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. \u201cRestraint\u201d is not the word that comes to mind.\n\nThis is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraq\u2019s oil resources as \u201cspoils to the victor.\u201d\n\nYes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations\u2014a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.\n\nAll the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump\u2019s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle\u2014a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don\u2019t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.\n\nEven if Walinsky\u2019s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.\n\nTo say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question\u2014and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.\n\nPeter Edelman is the Carmack Waterhouse professor of law and public policy at Georgetown University Law Center.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Peter Edelman", "Adam Walinsky"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.", "title": "Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump", "url": "http://politi.co/2coEDm7", "image": "http://static.politico.com/33/4c/4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3/160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/robert-f-kennedy-donald-trump-party-of-war-214274", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/33/4c/4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3/160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ca05472/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F4c%2F4d6ef8344746b686254cecd304f3%2F160922-edelman-kennedy-ap.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump", "url": "http://politi.co/2cGb5l5", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474560600000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/assets/abcn_images/abc_logo_aluminum.png", "text": "External links are provided for reference purposes.

The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.\n\nClinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health.\n\nTrump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, \"Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!\"\n\nJUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23\n\nClinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks.\n\n\"I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,\" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. \"I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.\"\n\nTo knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.\n\nClinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.\n\nBut Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton.\n\nClinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: \"There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything.\"\n\n\"There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,\" Clinton said.\n\nA team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal \"debate camp,\" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday.\n\nClinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for \"Art of the Deal,\" the best-seller about Trump.\n\nExpectations game\n\nClinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event.\n\n\"For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,\" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August.\n\nWith her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.\n\nTrump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.\n\nJUST WATCHED Debate expectations game is serious business Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Debate expectations game is serious business 02:46\n\nHer debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,\" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.\n\nClinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue.\n\nWhich Trump will show up?\n\nIn the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.\n\nClinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate.\n\nWhen asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra.\n\n\"I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,\" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. \"Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.\"", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny", "Dan Merica"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T10:15:58Z", "author": "Jeff Zeleny and Dan Merica, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump.", "pubdate": "2016-09-20T10:15:58Z", "title": "Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at debate", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-debate/index.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160414211934-brooklyn-democratic-debate-clinton-2-super-tease.jpg", "height": 619}, "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160414211934-brooklyn-democratic-debate-clinton-2-super-tease.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-debate/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at presidential debate - CNNPolitics", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Dan-Merica-659931107443856"}, "lastmod": "2016-09-26T11:17:13Z", "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160414211934-brooklyn-democratic-debate-clinton-2-super-tease.jpg", "description": "Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at debate"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-debate/index.html", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/08/19/donkey-elephant-boxing-webtag.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160925152145-debate-expectations-game-00021428-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160414211934-brooklyn-democratic-debate-clinton-2-super-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/04/28/politics_app_pageapp_promo_card_1600x900_v2.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919101915-hillary-clinton-terror-attacks-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160909202711-cnnee-trump-clinton-split-large-169.jpg"], "title": "Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at presidential debate", "url": "http://cnn.it/2cMNF03", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://cnn.it"}, {"top_img": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "text": "When Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns and allegedly paying zero in federal income taxes, the Republican presidential nominee had just four words to say in response.\n\n\u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Trump said from the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight.\n\nHe has said repeatedly he is being audited by the IRS and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns \u201cagainst my lawyer\u2019s wishes\u201d if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cAs soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,\u201d Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, \u201cI will release my tax returns.\u201d\n\nThe White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the \u201cmost extreme version\u201d of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. \u201cI call it trumped-up trickle-down because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBefore Trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, Clinton took another jab.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.\u201d\n\nTrump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.\n\nTrump fired back, blaming \u201cpoliticians like Secretary Clinton\u201d for plunging the nation into debt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a debtor nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on so many of your ideas.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that Trump\u2019s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. But Trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.\n\n\u201cIt would be squandered too, believe me,\u201d he said.\n\nABC News' Nicole Phillip, Maggie McNish and Sunny Choo contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Abc News", "More Morgan"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"fb_title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The candidates wasted no time in sparring over taxes and their tax plans.", "title": "Trump, Clinton Spar Over Taxes in 1st Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@MorganWinsor", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42379366", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42379366", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-09-28", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,42379366", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,42379366", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Date": "2016-09-28", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "Last-Modified": "2016-09-28 14:54:03", "keywords": "abcnews, debate, debates, hillary clinton, donald trump, taxes, economic, plan, policy, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "article": {"author": "/author/morgan_winsor"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "abcnews, debate, debates, hillary clinton, donald trump, taxes, economic, plan, policy"}, "canonical_link": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spar-taxes-presidential-debate/story?id=42379366", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_12x5_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/gty_debate_wide_from_back_ps_160926_16x9_992.jpg"], "title": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Spar Over Taxes in First Presidential Debate", "url": "http://abcn.ws/2dnuLiI", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcn.ws"}, {"top_img": "http://static.politico.com/0e/b6/f32701ea430d8f0e71ea1eb2390f/160920-early-voting-ap-16159732553066.jpg", "text": "In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. | AP Photo When does early voting start in every state? Voting has already started in a scattering of locations, and entire states will be able to vote starting Friday.\n\nElection Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president.\n\nVoting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.\n\nTypically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.\n\nHere\u2019s when early voting begins in each state.\n\n(Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.)\n\nAlabama \u2014 There\u2019s no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nAlaska \u2014 Oct. 24.\n\nArizona \u2014 Oct. 12.

Counties must send out absentee ballot requests no later than the 23rd, but are allowed to offer early voting. Early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality.\n\nIllinois \u2014 Sept. 29 to Nov. 7. Starting Sept. 29, voters can only cast their ballots at their local election authority or a temporary location, but early voting expands to permanent polling places starting Oct. 24.\n\nIndiana \u2014 Oct. 12. Early voting starts at the local county election board office or another designated location, but with an excuse, voters can cast a ballot by mail.\n\nIowa \u2014 Sept. 29.\n\nKansas \u2014 Oct. 19.

The counties mail out requests starting on the 3rd, but the first day to vote early in-person is Oct. 7.\n\nNevada \u2014 Oct. 22.\n\nNew Hampshire \u2014 There is no early voting in New Hampshire, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nNew Jersey \u2014 Sept. 24.

Absentee ballots have already been sent out, but the formal early voting period does not start until October.\n\nNorth Dakota \u2014 Sept. 29. Absentee and mail ballots can be sent out by county officials starting on the 29th, but the exact date might vary from one location to the next.\n\nOhio \u2014 Oct. 12.\n\nOklahoma \u2014 Nov. 3 to Nov. 5.\n\nOregon \u2014 Oct. 19.\n\nPennsylvania \u2014 There is no early voting in Pennsylvania, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nRhode Island \u2014 There is no early voting in Rhode Island, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nSouth Carolina \u2014 There is no early voting in South Carolina, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. The state does, however, give voters more absentee leeway than many.\n\nSouth Dakota \u2014 Sept. 23.\n\nTennessee \u2014 Oct. 19 to Nov. 3.\n\nTexas \u2014 Oct. 24 to Nov. 4.\n\nUtah \u2014 Oct. 25 to Nov. 4.\n\nVirginia \u2014 There is no early voting in Virginia, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nVermont \u2014 Sept. 23 to Nov. 7.

He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy, Trump\u2019s national political director, as an employee.\n\nTrump\u2019s advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004.\n\nDiscussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned that Trump\u2019s lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks.\n\nThe Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During this year\u2019s primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, following Paul\u2019s departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich.\n\nNeither Elsass nor a Trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Alex Isenstadt"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence.", "title": "Trump team talking to veteran GOP ad man Elsass", "url": "http://politi.co/2d8TxD9", "image": "http://static.politico.com/7e/a8/1194bbca4e39bd2edb3bed41956c/162009-donald-trump-getty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-ads-rex-elsass-228423", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/7e/a8/1194bbca4e39bd2edb3bed41956c/162009-donald-trump-getty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/0e4441b/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7e%2Fa8%2F1194bbca4e39bd2edb3bed41956c%2F162009-donald-trump-getty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump team talking to veteran GOP ad man Elsass", "url": "http://politi.co/2d2BkGM", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474384396000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "text": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide.\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a \u201cwounded country\u201d that \u201clooks bad to the world.\u201d\n\nPausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America\u2019s racial divide.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmerica desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we\u2019ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\u201d\n\nHe called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d\n\nHe also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing \u201cthe best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers\u201d and sympathized with police officers, who carry an \u201cimmense responsibility\u201d but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama\u2019s leadership, or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\u201d\n\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president\u2019s responsibility \u201cto address this crisis and save African-American lives,\u201d has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\n\nTrump's overtures to black voters \u2014 often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences \u2014 have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cdrugs are a very, very big factor\u201d in what's happening in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said there \u201cjust seems that there\u2019s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte \u2014 a great place \u2014 and you just see it.\u201d\n\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\n\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott\u2019s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video \"can somehow help us reach that truth.\"\n\nJustin Bamberg, another of the family\u2019s attorney\u2019s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that \u201cpictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.\u201d He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott\u2019s wife was present when he was shot.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,\u201d Bamberg said when asked why the family\u2019s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. \u201cYes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the \u201cdifficulties\u201d her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. \u201cI know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.\u201d\n\nWednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\n\n\u201cI see it even going out. There\u2019s such a lack of \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of spirit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of something. Something\u2019s going on that\u2019s bad, and what\u2019s going on between police and others is getting worse.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s wow, here we go again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. When you look at what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very divided, our country, and it\u2019s getting worse. I\u2019m not overly surprised to see it, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won\u2019t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was \u2014 that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there\u2019s something deeper than that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America\u2019s current leader.\n\n\u201cWell, it really has to be \u2014 you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there\u2019s no unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It\u2019s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it\u2019s so sad to see. But there\u2019s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.\u201d\n\nBut what Trump didn\u2019t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama\u2019s lack of leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we\u2019ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that\u2019s a tragic failure of leadership,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cBut my guess is he was afraid it\u2019d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,\u201d he added. \u201cHe could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday\u2019s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was \u201ca more difficult situation\u201d than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the \u201cambiguous, troubling category.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even there, you gotta say to people, \u2018Wait, let the investigation play out.\u2019 The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Nolan D", "Heather Caygle", "Rachael Bade", "Eli Stokols", "Louis Nelson", "Josh Gerstein"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "&quot;It\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d Trump says.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;It\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d Trump says.", "title": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest", "url": "http://politi.co/2d6AMQy", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-on-charlotte-protests-228512", "images": ["http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201609/1981/1155968404_5137187348001_5137175069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest", "url": "http://politi.co/2cJlAWU", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474532948000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "text": "President Obama is right \u2014 it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes.\n\nAfter Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it\u2019s \u201cnever been worse\u201d for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.\n\nWrong.\n\nAs usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren\u2019t successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s their own fault. She also said there wasn\u2019t \u201cany racism until Obama got elected\u201d and skirted problems under the table:\n\nIf you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\n\nMiller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201cstupid waste of time\u201d and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to \u201cthe way they\u2019re raised.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cthe way they\u2019re raised,\u201d supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn\u2019t vote (and couldn\u2019t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.\n\nMiller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump\u2019s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller\u2019s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple \u201cvolunteer\u201d to steer away any influence she once held.\n\nOnce again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it\u2019s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.\n\nFeatured image a screen-grab", "authors": ["Ryan Denson"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"publisher": "Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave", "description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0", "author": "Ryan Denson", "og": {"site_name": "AddictingInfo", "description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn\u2019t Exist Before Obama \u2013 Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Another racist Trump staffer.", "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn't Exist Before Obama - Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "image": "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "site": "@AddInfoOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 529217710562597, "pages": 146422995398181}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/politicsbyjustin/"}, "keywords": "Black Lives Matter, Donald Trump, ohio, racism", "google-site-verification": "jVoeEwkTNH-nlRuMnNJ8bZ2zUtHf0dCo_GKDu1InEl4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "http://addictinginfo.com/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "images": ["http://i.imgur.com/JeqZLhj.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=Ckvzg1awO700y8", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/rUJFIsF.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1ccf1e84217f74b13f4522b4f8d267?s=70&d=identicon&r=g", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Miller.jpg", "http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/masthead.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17503306&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.imgur.com/50AezNi.png"], "title": "Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn\u2019t Exist Before Obama \u2013 Promptly Resigns", "url": "http://author.addictinginfo.org/2016/09/22/trump-campaign-chair-says-racism-didnt-exist-before-obama-promptly-resigns/", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474502400000}, "source": "http://author.addictinginfo.org"}, {"top_img": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160910204806-north-korea-nuclear-test-explainer-ripley-orig-00020128-super-tease.jpg", "text": "(CNN) North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for \"aggression\" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with \"tremendous consequences beyond imagination.\"\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea \"had no other choice but to go nuclear,\" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself \"from the constant nuclear threats from the United States.\"\n\nRi's comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet.\n\nThe test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike.\n\nThe heightened tensions, North Korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice.\n\n\"North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,\" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. \"It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks.\"\n\nThe North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. \"Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,\" Ri said. \"We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation.\n\n\"The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,\" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting.\n\nHe called on allies to \"vigorously\" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to \"ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions.\"\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. \"Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,\" Abe said. \"There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now.\"\n\nThe perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October.\n\n\"From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,\" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS.\n\n\"For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,\" Evans said, adding that, \"The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival.\"\n\nUS officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea.\n\nNorth Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.\n\nIn May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.\n\nJUST WATCHED US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea 02:52\n\nPyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948.\n\nAnd Tuesday's rocket launch was \"substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,\" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nAll this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though.\n\nAfter the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that \"the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state.\"\n\nObama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and \"take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.\"\n\nHowever, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons.\n\n\"At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,\" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. \"We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.\"\n\nThe statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort.\n\nThe Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.\n\nPhotos: South Korea, U.S. hold 'largest ever' drills South Korean and U.S. troops staged an amphibious assault Saturday, March 12 as U.S. and South Korean military units embarked on eight weeks of annual joint military exercises.

On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions.\n\nInternational sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.\n\nThe international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil.\n\n\"That is a big step,\" Klingner said, \"it will impact the people of North Korea.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED General: US held 'nuclear hostage' by North Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH General: US held 'nuclear hostage' by North Korea 02:16\n\nChina signed on for the March sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say China historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against North Korea. US tensions with China over the South China Sea could make it harder to cooperate.\n\nDunford said Wednesday that \"China seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the Pacific.\"\n\nThe US can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on Pyongyang, Klingner said, by sanctioning non-North Korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely Chinese entities and financial institutions.\n\nIn the meantime, US military officials are planning.\n\nFrom October 3 to 21, the US and South Korea will carry out the joint exercise \"Red Flag\" in Alaska, which will include an aerial exercise \"simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack,\" a ministry spokesperson with the South Korean Defense Department told CNN.\n\nNorth Korea derided South Korea as a \"puppet warmongers\" in a statement about the Red Flag exercises.", "authors": ["Nicole Gaouette"], "keywords": [],

SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that \u201cin at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words \u201clie,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d \u201cfalsely claimed\u201d and \u201cuntrue\u201d appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper\u2019s Trump coverage.\n\nExecutive editor Dean Baquet\u201d said that \u201cI think our investigative work\u2014see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump\u2019s tax breaks\u2014has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies\u2026The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.\u201d\n\nHopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump\u2019s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump\u2019s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.\n\nBut it appears that Trump\u2019s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the \u201cbirther\u201d myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

Profile Everyone, Profile ME!\u201d [VIDEO]\n\nIt has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings\u2026 and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks\u2026 yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone\u2026 even him!\n\nCheck out the video below:\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\n\u201cEveryone needs to get smart. I\u2019m okay with profiling,\u201d Simmons declared. \u201cI want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I\u2019m clear, than profile someone else. It\u2019s emergency powers during war. There\u2019s a war going on.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. \u201cIt is unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the words \u2018too bad\u2019 exist.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isn\u2019t \u201cnice.\u201d But being nice doesn\u2019t prevent terrorism. Profiling does \u2014 just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they\u2019re not only still there, they\u2019re one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.\n\nMuslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in today\u2019s world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don\u2019t have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they don\u2019t, then what\u2019s the problem?\n\nLiberals complain that profiling violates people\u2019s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they\u2019re perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. They\u2019re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable?

Except for that one overweight cop that every station has. You know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. Forget him. He\u2019ll be on desk duty eventually. I\u2019m talking about real cops. The cops I know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. They will save any person that\u2019s in harms way. They don\u2019t care if the person is white, black, or even Muslim. A good cop saves everyone, and that\u2019s what most cops are \u2013 good cops.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nBut then there\u2019s this idiot from the LA Police Commission who wants cops to run AWAY from armed suspects. Are you kidding me? That\u2019s ridiculous. Cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.\n\nThe Daily Caller \u2013 The Los Angeles Police Commission wants LAPD police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union of the city\u2019s police officers.\n\nHypothetically speaking, if I wanted to rob a bank tonight, could I go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me?\n\nI don\u2019t have to stab anyone, I just have to show cops that I have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. Is that how it works?\n\nThat opens the Pandora Box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that LAPD might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future.\n\nI guess the LAPD won\u2019t be allowed to save lives anymore.\n\nVery sad state of affairs if this really happens.\n\nI hope every LAPD cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense.\n\nCops are trained for battle and they\u2019re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat.\n\nAnd we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger.\n\nTraining people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that\u2019s not who I want to protect me.", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"googlebot": "noimageindex", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Freedom Daily", "description": "I can't believe THIS is what they want cops to do.

support from young voters ahead of tonight's presidential debate.\n\nThe Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday.\n\nWhile some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide.\n\nSnapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says \"Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary\" before sharing with friends.\n\nThe filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nRelated: Say hello to Snap Inc.\n\nAnyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app.\n\nRelated: 100 million? Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate\n\nTrump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30), to target younger audiences.

The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds \u2014 about $2.5 million \u2014 and will be approximately 13 feet high.\n\nThere is a nearby migrant camp called \u201cthe Jungle\u201d that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom.

Police have called that area of Calais a \u201cno-go\u201d zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.\n\nIt is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. \u201cThis wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.\u201d\n\nLiberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump.

I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.\"\n\nHe added, \"New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.\"\n\nThe law enforcement policy \u2014 in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations \u2014 has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's.\n\nTrump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.\n\nHe has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump said, \"Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever\" \u2014 seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.\n\nOn Thursday morning, however, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends,\" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally.\n\n\"Now Chicago is out of control.

Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets \u2014 that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , \u201cIt sounds like you admitted you haven\u2019t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are \u2014 it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn\u2019t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that\u2019s been great to us. And you can\u2019t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump\u2019s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

this important matter,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.\n\nThe key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said \u2014 giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthood\u2019s partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants \u2014 a provision that had been a major point of contention.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans stand ready to move forward,\u201d McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. \u201cI would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.\u201d\n\nMcConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.\n\nBut the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood \u2014 particularly Profamilias, the health care provider\u2019s partner in Puerto Rico \u2014 from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.\n\nLanguage in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that\u2019s delayed Zika aid for months.\n\nDespite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said \u201cno\u201d when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.\n\n\u201cClose is relative,\u201d Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.\n\nFor instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.\n\nBut Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldn\u2019t accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do Flint.\u201d\n\nAnother issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to hand over the U.S. government\u2019s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 \u2014 a push that\u2019s being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans \u2014 even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is the coordination of the domain names. It\u2019s not who has control of the Internet,\u201d Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. \u201cAnd every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million \u2014 which it hasn\u2019t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank\u2019s board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.\n\nThere are other items that could fill up the Senate\u2019s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance \u2014 privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Burgess Everett", "Seung Min Kim", "Heather Caygle"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday.", "title": "McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal", "url": "http://politi.co/2cLp8XM", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ae/2d/1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a/160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/zika-funding-deal-congress-228366", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/ae/2d/1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a/160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/a3bec51/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fae%2F2d%2F1a0119fa45b89d4c83fc82a3079a%2F160713-mcconnell-gty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal", "url": "http://politi.co/2cksDqD", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474293333000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}, {"top_img": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150920215542-05-emmys-winners-super-tease.jpg", "text": "Story highlights \"Transparent\" creator Jill Soloway slammed Donald Trump backstage at the Emmys on Sunday night\n\nSoloway joined a chorus of criticism of the Republican presidential nominee during the awards show\n\n(CNN) One of the big winners at the Emmys on Sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of Donald Trump offstage -- comparing the Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to \"otherize\" groups of people.\n\nJill Soloway, creator of Amazon's \"Transparent\" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to \"Variety\" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into Trump.\n\n\"Jews were other-ized in Nazi Germany to gain political power for Hitler, and right now Donald Trump is doing the same thing.

Crowley\n\nPresidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor of mirroring Crowley\u2019s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night.\n\nIn an interview with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d Giuliani said he watched the debate two times \u2014 once live, \u201cand then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDonald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday\u2019s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an \u201cact of terror.\u201d (PolitiFact rated Romney\u2019s criticism \u201chalf true,\u201d noting that Obama did say \u201cact of terror\u201d right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak \u201cconsistently in the days that followed.\")\n\nGiuliani took issue with Holt \u201cignorantly\u201d attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.\n\nA federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThe former mayor maintained that \u201cevery cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America\u201d but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt \u201cbecause she failed the bar exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you\u2019re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I\u2019m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,\u201d Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night \u2014 if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you\u2019re gonna interrupt and you\u2019re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right.

Please direct further questions to USSS.\u201d\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC \u201cspecifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats\u201d on charter aircraft.\n\nA POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump\u2019s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.\n\nBut the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.\n\nTrump, who once said \u201cI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,\u201d has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.\n\nThe campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as \u201cmisleading and flat out wrong,\u201d pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.\n\nThe statement explained the campaign\u2019s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying \u201cthe campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\"It's basically just calling it even,\" Engle said. \"It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.\"\n\nThe same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it\u2019s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.\n\nThe Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.\n\nThe agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.\n\nOf course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump\u2019s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "authors": ["Kenneth P", "Jack Shafer", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Vogel Isaac Arnsdorf"], "keywords": [], "meta_data": {"description": "The agency pays to travel with all presidential nominees, but in Trump\u2019s case, that money went to one of his companies.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The agency pays to travel with all presidential nominees, but in Trump\u2019s case, that money went to one of his companies.", "title": "Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service", "url": "http://politi.co/2d86IUo", "image": "http://static.politico.com/bd/ef/782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920/162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "build": "release/2017-maria 4b1f874 2017-08-24T15:20:21Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-secret-service-campaign-travel-payments-228553", "images": ["http://static.politico.com/bd/ef/782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920/162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/b46e68e/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2Fef%2F782b3bea43b69f0bc5789acf8920%2F162209-trump-secret-service-getty-1160.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "title": "Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service", "url": "http://politi.co/2cQ4Ssc", "summary": "", "movies": [], "publish_date": {"$date": 1474571470000}, "source": "http://politi.co"}]
